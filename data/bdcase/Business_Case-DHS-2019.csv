HSIN is the only federal portal that provides information sharing among DHS and its partners across the full spectrum of homeland security missions. HSINs key customers and stakeholder are comprised of Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector and international officials engaged in emergency management, immigration control, fire services, emergency medical services, law enforcement and a number of other specific homeland security missions. The HSIN system groups key customers and stakeholders into Communities of Interest (COIs) so that coordination and collaboration can occur within specific mission areas. HSIN benefits its customer base through the provision of (1) a nationwide information exchange platform, (2) in a secure environment (3) where only trusted partners have access to separate knowledge space, (4) where document uploading and storage is enabled, (5) where real-time screen sharing collaboration is available, (6) with secure email messaging capability and secure chat capability. HSIN users require the capability to share information horizontally and vertically across diverse mission areas in a network of trust. Users gain uniform access to critical information through HSINs nationwide secure gateway and interoperability with selected trusted platforms.  Through HSIN, users gain access to timely and accurate information related to detecting, preventing, responding, and recovering from terrorist attacks and natural disasters; information regarding vulnerabilities and threats; information related to incident management to mitigate risks and reduce post incident loss of life and property;  and information related to emergency management response and recovery operations.",024-003,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3247 - Goal 5.1: Enhance National Preparedness, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","HSIN is used extensively to coordinate national security events, incident response, law enforcement activities and other homeland security operations. HSINs overarching return on investment (ROI) is not measured in dollars, but in lives saved, acts of terrorism prevented, events planned for, law enforcement actions conducted and serious incidents mitigated. Whether supporting security operations, enabling real-time coordination for incidents and response, or enabling intelligence analysis information sharing, HSIN continues to provide vital support to the homeland security enterprise. Analysis of O&M costs however, does provide a specific ROI calculation for the Cloud Migration program upgrade. Costs for the DHS data center support are around $3.8 million per year. Costs for the Cloud infrastructure are estimated at $1.8 million per year. Starting in FY18 after completion of the Cloud migration, the HSIN Program is expected to save $2.0 million in cost avoidance each year. Costs for the Program are currently about $26 million per year and would be $24 million after cost avoidance savings. The Return on Investment (ROI) for the HSIN Program after migration to the Cloud environment is estimated to be 1.08 overall (26/24=1.08).","Strategic requirements for this investment are derived in part from the National Strategy for Information Sharing, Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8 and the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review 2014.

SEVIS tracks information on nonimmigrants who are participating in the U.S. education system or designated exchange visitor program throughout the duration of their approved stay. Nonimmigrants may temporarily come to the US to study under three classes of admission: F for academic and language students, M for vocational students, and J for exchange visitors. SEVIS greatly improved efficiencies by using electronic means to capture critical F/M/J nonimmigrant information in a centralized repository. The use of the SEVIS increases data accuracy, reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information, improves the experience of school/program officials and nonimmigrants, and significantly increases data sharing across multiple government agencies reducing duplication of effort. Efficiencies are further improved through the ability of the web-based SEVIS application to be used in real-time for data updates and queries which reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information. SEVIS supports the DHS Mission by providing critical information needed to enforce immigration laws. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) within the ICE Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is the business sponsor that funds and manages SEVIS. SEVIS also supports the Department of State (DoS) Office of Private Sector Exchange in its mission.

SEVIS supports the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. Legislative Mandates for SEVIS include the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 which directed the development and conduct of a program to collect certain information on nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors. Following the 9-11 attack Congress enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act). Section 416 mandated the full implementation of SEVIS by January 1, 2003. Congress enacted the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 in January 2003. This Act clarified procedures for collecting and managing information on nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 delegated responsibility of SEVIS to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and required that SEVIS information be used to carry out enforcement functions.

In 2006, the Homeland Security Council Policy Coordinating Committee (HSC PCC) reported on a variety of national security vulnerabilities related to the admission of nonimmigrant students, including several needed and at times critical SEVIS improvements.

This investment includes: 
1) The Legacy Support System (LSS), a mainframe application that processes all the Write-Your-Own (WYO) insurance company flood policy and claims transactions;
2) The Bureau and Statistical Agent, which supports the iService system and the business services of the NFIP, by providing financial and statistical control, training materials for over 80 participating insurance companies, and multiple other business functions for the NFIP.
3) The NFIP Virtual Information Technology System (NVITS), which is the environment that hosts the FloodSmart and Underwriting & Claims Operation Review Tool (UCORT).
 
Without the capability embodied by the IT S&S investment, the NFIP would be unable to process flood insurance policies and claims for more than 5.3 million flood policies.   
 
As NFIPs System of Record, IT S&S investment is critical to mission attainment, helping facilitate flood insurance transactions like policy issuance and claims payments to flood survivors.   IT S&S supports the following DHS and FEMA missions: DHS Mission 5 (Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience), FEMA Strategic Priority 4 (Enable Disaster Risk Reduction Nationally), and Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA) Goal 2, Obj. 2.1 (Enhance Credibility/Effective Program Delivery). The key benefit of this investment is the continued operation of the NFIP and implementation of critical legislative reforms resulting from Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 and the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.

Given this length of time, it is likely that this system has provided a very favorable return on its original investment.  Additionally, this system allows the NFIP to sell flood insurance and pay claims to U.S. persons in a time of flooding disaster. 
 
As described in responses to accomplishment questions later in the business case the continued operation of the Legacy Support System (the IT system within the IT S&S investment) is critical to the day-to-day operation of the NFIP, just as the support functions provided by the continued work funded under the BSA contract is critical to NFIPs ability to update program documentation; respond to flooding disasters by opening Flood Response Offices (FRO), and providing training to key stakeholders, including claims adjusters.

(615,018,000/470,794,446.25)  1 = .306. An ROI of .31 indicates that the Program increases benefits to society such that the initial investment is recovered, and a return (savings in excess of original investment) is incurred. We calculated the ROI by dividing External Benefits by Total Cost of the Program (per signed LCCE, December 2016). We defined External Benefits as the estimated cost savings for federal agencies using IPAWS and the value of lives saved by IPAWS usage.   
The IPAWS investment objects to improve the amount of time the IPAWS infrastructure is available for use and the time it takes to disseminate alerts and warnings to the public upon receipt. This enhances the effectiveness and efficiency by which public safety officials can provide warning messages to all people in a danger area - increasing the likelihood that people receive timely warning information and the likelihood that people will take action to avoid or mitigate the impact of disaster incidents.  Disaster impact avoidance and mitigation benefits society by enabling people to take protective measures saving lives and reducing the cost of response and recovery activities after a disaster  representing future savings for federal, state, local, private sector, and private citizens. 
IPAWS also aims to increase the coverage of the population covered by FEMA PEP Stations and local level public safety officials with access to IPAWS. The integrated interoperable systems and open standards interfaces of IPAWS create a simple gateway between public safety officials and multiple communications systems supporting access for public alert and warning message delivery. The small IPAWS investment in infrastructure, agreements, and partnerships enables authorized agencies, including more than 20,000 non-federal public safety officials, to utilize multiple private sector infrastructure investments to communicate emergency warning information to people. Access via IPAWS is free for authorized public safety agencies, representing cost savings for using agencies versus developing, deploying and sustaining independent systems for local alert and warning capabilities.","The IPAWS Program was established to implement the requirements in EO 13407 to create a more effective, reliable, integrated, flexible, and comprehensive system to alert and warn the American people before, during, and after disasters.

Specifically, the goals of LSCMS include the ability to:

 - Manage the entire supply chain, including FEMA-owned assets and resources as well as those provided by partners in other federal agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
 - Ensure the right resources/commodities are available at the right place and time 
 - Divert resources/commodities based on changing demand
 - Know the location and status of capital assets, commodities, and all other resources in real time
 - See inventory at all distribution nodes (e.g. Distribution Centers (DCs), Incident Support Bases (ISBs), Mobile Housing Unit (MHU) sites, and material delivered to state staging areas and local Points of Distribution (PODs)
 - Integrate with the supply chains of partners in federal government agencies, and other Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) and non-ESF federal agencies, NGOs, and logistics service vendors
 - Share supply chain data with state/local/tribal governments

The LSCMS aligns with DHS strategic goals.  The system supports Strategic Plan ""Mission 5: Strengthen National Preparedness"", DHS Goals: 5.3; Ensure Effective Emergency Response, Objective 5.3.1: Provide Timely and Accurate Information to the Public and Objective 5.3.2: Conduct Effective Disaster Response Operations.  Stakeholders of LSCMS include DHS/FEMA senior leadership, FEMA logistics management, FEMA regional management, FEMA IT (e.g., EA and Security), and other FEMA Divisions (e.g., National Preparedness, Disaster Assistance, Disaster Operations), State/local/tribal government, Emergency Support Function agencies, vendors/suppliers/carriers/logistics providers, oversight bodies (including Congress, OMB, GAO, OIG), and media.  Direct customers are FEMA HQ and regions, ESF partners, and state emergencymanagers and responders.  The ultimate customers are citizens who benefit from the timely delivery of disaster relief assets.

Specific benefits include improvements in billing accountability, receiving processes, inventory accountability/accuracy, visibility, trailer load times, reporting, commodity management, and quality assurance.",024-008,"3242 - M&S Goal 6.2: Enhance Partnerships and Outreach, 3249 - Goal 5.3: Ensure Effective Emergency Response, 46751 - Enhance Disaster Preparedness and Response","In April 2014 DHS issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum directing FEMA to pause new development of LSCMS to allow time to conduct a critical analysis and determine and approve a path forward. An analysis of gaps to current requirements, a limited analysis of alternatives (AoA) to address the gaps, and an operational benchmarking similar to other logistics operations is to be performed. The LSCMS Program Office worked with DHS to obtain AoA contractor expertise from MITRE - timeframe to complete the AoA Study Plan is 11/20/14 and the Limited AoA by 11/30/15.
 
Annual LSCMS acquisition costs vary, O&M costs change as development components are implemented and public benefits, disaster frequency and severity are unpredictable. The ROI formula has too many unpredictable components to be calculated precisely, but an ROI qualitative analysis is useful:
ROI=(((Original Baseline O&M - New Total O&M) + Other Benefits to Society)/Acquisition Cost Only)-1
   
The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2028 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)
   
Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in benefits to society.
 Previous O&M = averaged $29.85M
 New O&M = $24.88M
With increasing resource costs, O&M costs are not anticipated to decrease.
 System cost Benefits = $5M
 Public Benefits > $20M
  
ROI = (((29.854M-24.883M)+385.550M)/102.017)-1 = 283%
System cost benefits include: Savings from developmental alternatives, resource optimization and hardware and asset inventory; cost avoidances from reduction in legacy O&M costs, better asset management and COOP; and productivity improvements from data visibility, automation, and partner integration.","The Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA) directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop an efficient, transparent, and flexible logistics system for procurement and delivery of materials and services necessary for an effective and timely response and recovery, and for real-time visibility of items at each point throughout the logistics system (Public Law 109-295-Oct 4, 2006; Sec. 636, Logistics).

These statutes require DHS to prevent individuals from entering a secure area of a vessel or facility unless the individual holds a transportation security card or is accompanied by another individual who holds a card.
Contribution to Mission Delivery or Agency Management Support Functions: In accordance with the DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog, Version 2.0, dated June 2014, the TWIC program supports the PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY Mission and the Screening function as listed in the Capability Portfolio.  As of August 1, 2016, more than 4.0 million workers had applied for a TWIC.
Goals: The TWIC program provides a vital security measure to ensure that individuals who pose a security threat do not gain unescorted access to secure areas of the nations maritime transportation industry. 
Current or Anticipated Benefits: TSA (1) positively verifies each applicants claimed identity; (2) performs a security threat assessment on each applicant; and (3) produces and issues a TWIC card containing biometric and physical information for each applicant meeting the threat assessment eligibility requirements. The TWIC security threat assessment provides a terrorism/intelligence check, a criminal history records check, and an immigration check. TWICs are tamper-resistant biometric credentials. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Key Customers: Facility employees, longshoremen, merchant mariners, deckhands, long haul and drayage truck drivers, laborers, chemical facility workers, and others requiring unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels.
Stakeholders and other Beneficiaries:  Extensive outreach to Congress; American Association of Port Authorities; National Association of Waterfront Employers; American Trucking Association; American Waterways Operators; Offshore Marine Service Association; Passenger Vessel Association; Intermodal Association of North America; International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union; Chemical Sector Coordinating Council (SCC), and others including the approximately 2800 MTSA-regulated facilities and 10,000 regulated vessels.",024-024,"3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks, 3264 - Goal 1.3:  Reduce Risk to the Nation's Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events","The benefit of the TWIC program is that it improves security by a common nation-wide secure biometric credential that is used by operators of the national maritime transportation infrastructure to make access control decisions. The TWIC program established standards and processes for enrollment, vetting, adjudication, redress, card issuance and activation.  In addition, TSA continuously monitors all TWIC holders for terrorism risks and revokes credentials when the individual is no longer eligible for TWIC.  The TWIC program currently reports 7 key performance metrics:  Average Adjudication Total Accuracy Rate, Invalid Enrollment Rate, Customer Satisfaction, Average Wait Time, Operational Availability, Program Financial Commitment Variance, and Program Viability.  The TWIC program continually reviews metrics and in 2017, the TWIC program is re-evaluating current performance measures to develop more effective metrics aligned with program objectives.  
To calculate ROI, the program did a cash flow analysis using the TWIC Funding History report published by the TSA CFO which has the history of funding for the program up to September 30, 2016.  ROI for the TWIC program is calculated as (Cash In  Cash Out)/Cash Out.  Cash In is derived from two sources, appropriated funding provided early in the program and fee revenue collected from transportation workers once the program reached operational capability.  Consequently, as of September 30, 2016, Cash In (Appropriations) $155.875M + Cash In (Fees) $701.317M = $857.192M; Cash Out (Expenses) = $481.137M; therefore, ROI = ($857.192M-$481.137M)/$481.137M = 78.16%.  The details for this method are included in the first tab of the TWIC Funding History report which is uploaded.","Legislative Mandate:  The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2002 requires DHS to issue a biometric transportation security card to those requiring unescorted access to MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels after determining the individual does not pose a security risk.  The TWIC program provides a secure credential and biometric security card for eligible transportation workers who require unescorted access to areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels.  TWIC positively identifies applicants by determining the authenticity of identity documentation, and it conducts a Security Threat Assessment (STA) on each individual, including continuous vetting against Terrorist Screening Databases.
 
Agency Strategic Plan:  TWIC supports DHS Strategic Goal 1.1  Prevent Terrorist Attacks and Goal 1.3 Reduce Risk to the Nations Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events.  Via enrollment and vetting processes, TWIC prevents ineligible applicants from obtaining a TWIC card to gain unescorted access to facilities and vessels.  Also, TWIC supports TSA Strategic Goal 1.0 - Establish a risk-based approach to all operations to identify, manage, and mitigate risk in all TSA lines of business, and Goal 2.0 - External Engagement - Sustain transparent and proactive relationships with external stakeholders and the traveling public.  The TWIC programs enrollment, vetting, and adjudication processes maintain effective controls to mitigate the risk of an ineligible applicant obtaining a TWIC card.  Also, the TWIC program uses customer service strategies, a stakeholder communications committee, visits to individual facilities and Coast Guard districts/sectors, and speaking at national stakeholder conferences and meetings to maintain communication with transit workers and maritime industry representatives.
 
Outstanding Audit Finding:  As of August 2016, the TWIC program is addressing a GAO recommendation to perform an internal control assessment by analyzing existing controls, identifying related weaknesses and risks, and determining cost effective actions needed to achieve program objectives.  In FY 2017, TSA will conduct an internal control assessment of the TWIC program to further identify internal control strengths, risks, and vulnerabilities.

STIPs mission aligns to the following DHS QHSR and DHS Strategic Plan Missions: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security, Strengthen National Preparedness, and Mature and Strengthen the DHS Enterprise and the following DHS Goals: Risk Based Security and Organizational Efficiency. 
The anticipated benefits expected from this investment are; 1. STIP has the ability to push software updates from a central location to TSE in the field programmatically, significantly reducing the time to implement these updates.  2. Improve property management and configuration control by providing the automated capabilities necessary to maintain a higher level of standardization and oversight of equipment operations. 3. Improve the timeliness and accuracy of checkpoint and checked baggage information by automating and centralizing the collection and management of operational and performance data.
STIP stakeholders are  Airlines; airport authorities; local, state and federal law enforcement organizations; local, state and federal regulatory agencies; vendors; TSA Office of Security Operations (OSO), including Federal Security Directors (FSD) and their staff; Office of Acquisition Program Management (OAPM), including the Mission Analysis Division (MAD), Deployment Division, Checkpoint Technologies Division (CTD), Checked Baggage Technologies Division (CBTD), and the Operations Support Division (OS); Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA); Maintenance Service Providers (MSPs); and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Support Contractors, Air Carriers, Airport Authorities, American Association of Airport Executives(AAAE),Air Transportation Association (ATA), Airport Council International  North America (ACINA), International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Other beneficiaries are the airline travelers and local law enforcement.",024-023,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","The ROI of 87.8% was based on investing in three scenarios, in which the cost savings represented as the net present value (NPV) was compared to the lifecycle cost of the program, in order to determine the profability of the program. If the three scenarios are invested, then this would provide the highest NPV of roughly $82 million. If no action is taken, then the NPV would be $52 million, and the ROI is reduced to 0%. By integration/networking of screening equipment (TSE), STIP provides cost savings for TSA through efficiencies gained by 1) automating data collection process which results in time savings for TSOs no longer having to manually collect data from all the STIP-enabled TSEs at the check point and checked baggage area.  2) Remote Monitoring and Maintenance (RMM) capability has the potential to reduce time required for maintenance technicians to travel to the TSE that requires diagnostics and consequently reduce maintenance costs for EBSP and PSP.     
Benefits of a continued investment in STIP baseline capabilities and software development to have the STIP Application Suite (STIP AS) interface with the Office of Security Operations (OSO) Performance Information Management System/Performance Management Information System (PIMS/PMIS) include a reduction of the data collection burden that each airport has to undertake to collect various data points and manually enter into the PIMS/PMIS database.  An additional investment for EMD (Enhanced Metal Detector) retrofits to enable automated collection of passenger throughput and alarm data counts will result in the enhancement of STIP baseline capabilities, due to higher accuracy and fidelity of passenger counts, developed and further reduce the OSO data collection burden.  Investment in future software development efforts and business process development for a Remote Monitoring and Maintenance (RMM) capability  provides benefits in terms of maintenance savings for TSEs, regardless of their warranty status or maintenance provider.  Additionally, RMM provides efficiencies gained by streamlining the maintenance issue diagnosis and resolution and the potential for an increase in uptime of TSE. 
A positive ROI indicates that the purchase and implementation of new capital assets to create a new capability should result in a net reduction in recurring costs over the investment lifecycle greater than the total of the original non-recurring costs required to create said capability.","STIP is an Information Technology (IT) program with the goal of addressing the need for an automated exchange of information between TSE and TSA stakeholders. By addressing this need, STIP addresses the following key capability gaps identified by the TSA: 
 
1.      Security: TSA lacks the capability to dynamically transfer information between TSE and vetting and security operations. 
2.      Configuration Management: TSA lacks the capability to automatically upload configuration updates and software on TSE, as well as capability to efficiently collect, track, and harmonize configuration settings on TSE.
3.       Information Sharing and Enterprise Management: TSA lacks the capability to automate data collection processes used to capture and upload operational data for TSE.
4.      Resource Management: TSA lacks the capability to automatically collect Transportation Security Officer (TSO) threat detection performance data from TSE. 
5.      Remote Monitoring and Maintenance: TSA lacks the capability to remotely monitor and maintain the health of TSE.

024-000005664,173,01 - Major IT,01 - Not Applicable,"	024",Department of Homeland Security,"	45",Transportation Security Administration,TSA - Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program,"TIM implements TSA's centralized system for enrollments, vetting, adjudication and redress mission services in support of the maritime, surface and aviation programs. The TIM Program mission is aligned and consistent with the overarching DHS and TSA mission, DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security. The TIM System supports operations by reducing the probability of a successful terrorist attack on the transportation system by applying threat assessment methodologies intended to identify known or suspected terrorist threats working in or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system.
TIM is being built and operated in the DHS datacenter cloud environment. TIM is a fully integrated system utilizing service oriented architecture capable of providing more effective and efficient security threat assessments to all transportation sectors including: surface, maritime and aviation. TIM is the Security Threat Assessment infrastructure focal point for stakeholders including: Congress, FBI, State Department, Coast Guard, State & Local agencies, U.S. airports, U.S. ports, as well as transportation employers, transportation employees, and travelers.
The TIM programs goals are to improve customer service, provide one-stop shopping, enable a person-centric view, to implement enroll, once and use many, to increase the efficiency of security threat assessments and information sharing with federal, state, local authorities and industry partners, to promote secure operations, to support fee-fairness and comparability between credentials for  transportation workers,and to realize economies of scale; as well as operational efficiencies through integration of processes.
TIM customers (transportation workers and travelers) will benefit from the efficiencies and cost avoidance once TIM is fully implemented. Workers and travelers will also experience improved service at a lower cost. TIM is poised to be an Enterprise-level solution for Screening Coordination Office (SCO) Credentialing Framework Initiatives (CFI). TIM is one of the first DHS programs to use DHS Data Center Cloud Services. TIM is paving the way for new security and data sharing methodologies. TIM is a DHS agile pilot program that enables agile responses to changing business conditions and operational requirements via engineered business processes, and seamless information sharing services based on managed data (accurate, timely, trustable) with tuned IT performance.",024-025,3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks,"TIM is a Performing Program.  Though not fully implemented yet, the TIM Program already eliminates redundant business practices and processes, TIM will also achieve cost and performance efficiencies by integrating now separate IT systems (TWIC, Consolidated Screening Gateway, Screening Gateway, Crew Vetting, Alien Flight Student Program) functionality under one program.  TIM enables support for external stakeholders such as Maritime, Surface, and Aviation transportation worker / traveler populations.

As demonstrated by reporting on operational performance metrics 230776 (Unit Cost of Processing ...) and 214428 (Operational Availability ...), TIM provides TSA internal benefits by enabling information sharing across TSA / DHS .  Additionally, with the implementation of the re-baseline, and the introduction of additional populations beyond Maritime, TIM will commence reporting on Operational Performance metrics 214427 (Enroll Once Use Many...), and 214431 (Security Threat Assessment Response Time...).

The TIM system is being designed to function in a cloud environment.  TIM's cloud infrastructure will result in significant cost savings, especially in future years during the O&M phase.  These savings will be evidenced by metrics 214427, 214428, 214429 (Cases automatically processed ...), and 214430 (MTBF).  Benefits to external stakeholders include streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person-centric which will be documented by metric 214427, and 230776.

TIM is person centric in that the system recognizes workers applying for multiple credentials, endorsements, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation modes.  This person-centric capability enables TSA to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities which saves users time and money.

TIM's STA process uses biometric and biographic information to perform automated immigration,criminal history, finger print, and terrorist watch list checks.  The transportation worker must have an approved STA to start or continue work, or even to apply for a job within the US transportation infrastructure.  Any significant delays impact the worker and may also impact commerce.","Maritime Transportation Security Act.

In determining the ROI, the R21 Key Decision Point (KDP) 1 was completed in Jul 1995 and authorized entry into the programs Concept and Technology Demonstration phase under the authority of DOT. In Aug 1999, KDP2 authorized the program to proceed into the Capability Development and Demonstration phase. In Aug 2001, the Coast Guard awarded three R21 Phase I contracts to competing contractors to develop proposed system designs. The Phase I proposals were reviewed in late 2001 and the Phase II production contract RFP was issued in Feb 2002. Following a formal source selection process, the USCGs Source Selection Official (SSO) awarded the R21 Phase II production contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems in Sep 2002. In Jul 2005, DHS authorized the R21 program to proceed into the Production and Deployment phase and full rate production subsequently commenced in Sep 2005.  
Internal Benefits: R21 is used to tailor CG response (including coordinating with local first responders and federal coordinators), significantly reducing response time to mariners in distress. The R21 system enhances the CGs ability to detect & respond to distress calls in the coastal zone, which directly benefits the U.S. publics marine safety & saves lives. Benefits also include system disaster recovery capabilities that have supported coordination in numerous federals regional response and remediation efforts by providing a critical communication backbone in the disaster regions. For example, the R21 system provided a communication system that supported efforts to re-open ports in NY and NJ after hurricane Sandy.

NAIS is a data collection, processing and distribution system that provides international Maritime Organization (IMO)-adopted Automatic Identification System (AIS) information to enhance safety of navigation and our Marine Transportation System (MTS), and improve Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The project provides the necessary capability to ensure the effective exchange of information  between AIS-equipped vessels, aircraft, ATON, and shore stations within all major U.S. ports, waterways, and coastal zones.  It integrates a network of AIS receivers and transmitters, data processing and storage centers, and user interface services that capture, exchange, and analyze data of critical interest for maritime safety and security.  Data collected supports the nation's maritime interest, from the safety of vessels and ports through collision avoidance, to the safety of the nation through detection, traffic identification, and classification of vessels.
Benefits/Stakeholders:
The data collected by NAIS will be shared with other pertinent stakeholders and decision makers in support of maritime security at critical ports.  NAIS supports a layered defense and requirements for Advanced Notice of Arrival by correlating AIS data with target vessel reporting and other maritime awareness data to focus resources on higher interest vessels.  The key customers and primary beneficiaries of NAIS include: USCG, CBP, Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, IRS, indirectly to the international community through MSSIS, and port partners.  Maritime Operational Threat Response benefits in achieving a coordinated U.S. Government response to threats to the US in the maritime domain.  NAIS will facilitate the Coast Guard response to threats in the maritime domain by enabling better visibility of suspect vessels as well as other vessels in the vicinity.  NAIS will allow for visibility and tracking of U.S. Government vessel assets for improved overall coordination of resources.  Maritime Communications benefits are associated with improved USCG ability to communicate with vessels in support of various USCG missions.  These benefits include the enhanced exchange of navigation information, improved communications interoperability with foreign vessels and other Government agencies' vessels, and backup capability to the Rescue 21 voice systems via AIS messaging.  The following USCG systems are dependent upon NAIS: IOC,  WebCOP, eGIS, MISLE, and MAGNet.",024-037,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","NAIS improves maritime domain awareness and offers improvements in collision avoidance, maritime safety, environmental protection and national security through the detection, classification and tracking of vessels whether they are in national water or still thousands of miles off shore.  

The ROI of 7.94, as calculated in the NAIS Alternatives Analysis of Dec 29, 2006, was calculated by determining the sum of the present value of all benefits and dividing it by the sum of the present value of all costs of each capability.  The benefits of security risk reduction (such as detection of large commercial vessel introduces WMD into US port and fishing vessel has a crew member onboard suspected of being a terrorist) are included in the ROI calculation.  The benefits of operational performance (such as improved Search and Rescue detection and response and collision detection and enforcement) have not been included because the confidence in those calculations was low; however if they were to be included, the ROI would be even higher.  The benefits were calculated for the following capabilities provided by NAIS: coastal receive, coastal transmit, long range receive, advanced data capability, and inland waters receive and transmit.  For each capability a variety of scenarios were evaluated using probabilities of occurrence and consequence costs to demonstrate the improvement in security risk by implementing NAIS.  

The present value of all costs of each capability was calculated using the LCCE produced as part of the NAIS Alternatives Analysis document.  The total benefit was calculated as $5,704,345,592; the total LCC was calculated as $718,062,000; the ROI was calculated as 7.94.  

While 7.94 is the ROI for the whole NAIS system, each Increment offers improvements in each capability to differing degrees.  Increment 1 primarily benefits coastal receive.  After recapitalization of Increment 1 with Increment 2, the return on investment is significant improvement of marine safety and security by increasing receive coverage from 24nm to 50 nm, the addition of transmit capability out to 24 nm, and advanced data capability.  Increment 3 primarily benefits long range receive.","NAIS derives from the U.S. obligations under Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974,  an international treaty, calls for automatic identification system of vessels; Maritime Transportation Safety Act (MTSA) Act of 2002 which is CG efforts in improving its knowledge of the ships calling at U.S. ports as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).

The program acquires and implements the C4ISR capabilities mandated by the ORD to improve the USCG response to emerging threats and hazards within the maritime domain. C4ISR mission needs, threats and gaps described in the 2004 Deepwater Mission Need Statement (MNS) were validated in a 2012 C4ISR MNS and remain valid. C4ISR concerns extend beyond deepwater regions to wherever USCG assets are relied upon to support the services enduring roles of Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship. To effectively respond to the threats facing our maritime region, the C4ISR modernization program will focus on the following priorities: Functionality: Obtain core C4ISR for air, surface, intelligence and shore; Interoperability: Transition from proprietary to government to open solutions; Implementation: Net-centric design, initial asset installs and upgrades and back-fits; Supportability: Lab infrastructure that supports the Governments role as system integrator and keeps pace with evolving information technology demands and standard changes; Sustainment: Technology development and upgrades that reduce O&M costs. The program is considered to be in an ""Obtain"" lifecycle phase. The lifecycle funding shown in this business case represents only the Acquisition, Construction & Improvement (AC&I) funding provided by the C4ISR program, which is limited to the design and development of C4ISR systems for USCG assets.  O&M costs are not included as they are managed by the USCG sustainment community.

Stakeholders include DHS, DoD, CG operators, Sponsor (CG-7), and Technical Authority (CG-6). 

The program has completed delivery of baseline C4ISR capability (Increment 1), as well as the federated CGC2 baseline(Segment 2), to 25 aviation assets (8 LRS, 17 MRS). The Increment 1 baseline was installed on the first four NSC assets, and the program is in the process of delivering Segment 2 (Sea Commander) capability to those assets. Segment 2 will be installed during production on NSC#5 and beyond. The program is coordinating and tailoring the SEAWATCH design for OPC C4ISR. The program also supports newly-acquired assets with C4ISR IA/TEMPEST/C&A/IV&V efforts and  communications  upgrades to  in-service cutters.",024-032,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","For each class of Coast Guard assets, the C4ISR program designs and develops the software and hardware systems that enable the Coast Guard to collect operational and intelligence data; process and integrate that data into operationally valued and assured information; and analyze, evaluate, and/or interpret the available operational and intelligence information into actionable knowledge. An asset equipped with modern C4ISR equipment will be able to synthesize its own sensor data with data from other sources, such as Coast Guard and partner agency ships, aircraft, and shore commands. This functionality allows Coast Guard units to see, hear, and process what all other friendly assets see, hear, and process, facilitating tactical decisions for operational commanders  both on-scene and from afar. This enhances situational awareness within maritime areas of the United States, specifically focusing on the mitigation of possible threats from terrorists and other criminals, while concurrently observing and assisting legitimate users in American ports, waterways, and coastal regions. 
The C4ISR system is on the front end of a long value chain that ultimately results in the economic benefits of lives saved, drugs interdicted, and perpetrators apprehended, supporting the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and DHS Strategic Goals. An ROI analysis would not be informative as this is not a financially-driven initiative. 
The return on investment for C4ISR Segment 2 is represented by numerous qualitative enhancements over the Segment 1 system that will aid the Coast Guard in meeting mission needs. Segment 2 is designed to meet the critical interoperability requirements for exchanging information with mission partners (DOD, DHS, OGAs, state, local, and/or foreign governments). Other user efficiencies that are provided by Segment 2 include a fully capable transmit/receive Link-11 solution; the creation of the real-time tactical domain, with redundancy and failover capability; IFF tracker integration; conversion from Network Attached Storage to a hybrid Storage Attached Network for increased capacity and reliability; a Central Control System to execute admin functions from any console; and network management and system monitoring upgrades.","The C4ISR program's overarching requirements are linked to the requirements set forth by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) establishment as directed in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296 (https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/hr_5005_enr.pdf) and also in the DHS Strategic Goals (http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/dhs-strategic-plan-fy-2012-2016.pdf).

These capabilities have been leveraged and integrated to expand the capabilities to inbound pedestrian, outbound vehicle and pedestrian, and U.S. Border Patrol (BP) checkpoint processing; and improve existing primary processing operations.
LBIs goals are to facilitate the flow of travelers into the U.S. in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to Secure and Manage Flows of People and Goods while minimizing disruption and facilitating safe and secure inbound and outbound legal flows of people and goods; increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of land border processing; and integrate data to support intelligence and targeting within the Land Border Triangle: inbound, checkpoint, and outbound.
Benefits include: vehicle (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without LBI technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes; reduced manual license plate corrections and fewer time and labor intensive secondary referrals. The reduced number of acceptable documents, and increased document security features make it easier for officers to identify fraudulent documents.  LBI extended benefits from initial inbound vehicle capabilities by ensuring that vehicle and document data can also be acquired when vehicles leave the U.S. (outbound) or travel within the U.S. interior (U.S. Border Patrol checkpoints).  LBI has also extended these benefits to travelers entering the U.S. on foot (pedestrians) and buses.
Key LBI customers include CBP officers, U.S. Border Patrol agents, and the traveling public.  LBI stakeholders include CBP officers and agents, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State, Mexico and Canada. The beneficiariesare the traveling public and the governments of Canada, and Mexico and their citizens.  The original LBI  investment allowed CBP to address the requirements imposed by Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), Public Law 108-458), as amended, by June 1, 2009.  LBI capabilities add security and decrease inbound primary processing time, which reduces border wait time.",024-044,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","LBI provides technologies and infrastructure to improve border operation facilitation and security.   For inbound vehicle and pedestrian processing, RFID technologies, upgraded LPRs, an improved primary inspection application, direction variable message signage, traffic management devices, and policies like active lane management (ALM) expedite border crossing, more efficiently use scarce officer and infrastructure resources.  For example, the promotion of RFID technology and new RFID document options result in more efficient processing methods: vehicles (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without the RFID technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes.  The improved LPRs have reduced manual plate corrections by 10 million per year further reducing process time and improving security.  The benefits that accrue from the technical facilitation (RFID, LPR, VPC) of the crossing process are far reaching: increased throughput per officer, reduced border crossing wait time, and increased capacity to accommodate increases in border crossing volume.  Increased border crossing volume has a positive impact on the U.S. economy.  These capabilities also provide more enhanced information about travelers which improves border crossing security.  LBI returns are calculated based on the difference in wait time prior to LBI compared to post LBI, and by estimating the value of that time for the traveling public.  The original WHTI Land Regulatory Analysis establish low, medium and high values ($ per hour) for both business and private travelers.  These value factors are multiplied by the net wait time differences to arrive at an estimated total return.  Therefore, the LBI Return on Investment (ROI) of 94.00 is calculated as the wait time traveler value minus the LBI investment (Acquisition and O&M) divided by the LBI investment.","The LBI investment was authorized by Congress to address the requirements imposed by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), Public Law 108-458), as amended.

The 3 phase implementation of SAP was completed in October of 2004. This effort was undertaken as a result of an analysis of legacy Customs Asset Management Processes and replaced numerous legacy financial, procurement, and property systems with a single, fully integrated solution.  SAP provides many benefits to CBP including: complete integration of business processes within one system, improved financial statement reporting and internal controls, reduced cycle-time, elimination of duplicate data entry, improved data accuracy, single system reporting, and enhanced analytical reporting. SAP ensures that CBP is in compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems. The system has dependencies to other CBP systems in the form of interfaces and data transfers that enable the accurate and complete recording of financial and associated transactions. Those systems include Concur Government Edition, Customs Overtime Scheduling System (COSS), and the CBP Automated Collection System (ACS) to name a few. SAP provides the financial, procurement, and asset tracking which allows CBP to accomplish its mission.  The SAP approach reduces functional gaps identified in past audits and raises performance to acceptable industry benchmarks.  The SAP Project is in a steady - state mode under the Investment Management Process. CBP is now state-of-the-art and has been identified as a leader in Financial Management by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  SAP supports QHSR Mission 2; Secure and Manage our Borders.  The SAP system must be maintained and supported so that CBP financial staff can meet their timelines and efficiency targets which help CBP to operate effectively.  Maintaining SAP will also help CBP continue receiving unqualified audit opinions.  The primary beneficiaries of the system include the over 7,400 CBP field and headquartersrole-based users as well as CBP and DHS management who utilize the data and information processed and reported on in SAP. Other stakeholders for the SAP program include the Office of Finance and the Office of Information Technology as co-sponsors of the program; as well as others who rely on accurate financial data from CBP.",000-000,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","SAP is an integrated resource planning (ERP) system that replaced ten stove-piped, outdated, and underperforming mainframe systems that resulted in audit findings of significant internal control weaknesses and were deemed insufficient and no longer suited to meeting data processing and reporting needs.  SAP adequately addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  The elimination of duplicate entry manual processes in both asset and financial management have created significant cost savings.  The QPAM analysis in 1999 found that implementation of an ERP system would generate the following reductions in government labor related to asset and financial management:  Planning reduced by 38%, Budgeting by 8.6%, Acquisition by 27.4%, Pay and Expend by 50%, and Monitor and Control would be reduced by 46%.  
SAP continues to be a good investment for CBP and the federal government.  In FY2016 with over $19 billion in budgetary resources, CBP collected over $44 billion in revenue and managed $16 billion in assets.  As an integrated ERP system, SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting.  CBP has received an unqualified opinion on stand-alone audits each year since 1996, running on SAP since 2004. 
Additionally, the SAP program measures program performance annually via the Operational Analysis covering the following areas:  Customer Results, Strategic and Business results, Financial Performance, Innovation, Performance Measure Results, and Risk Assessment. 
Based on the Office of Finance Customer Satisfaction Surveys in FY2017 the SAP Overall Average Satisfaction Rating remained consistently high at 4.00 out of a possible 5.0 across all components.  The Technical Performance Analysis of SAP shows the system availability is above 99% for the 2017 fiscal year to date.  The Strategic and Business/Mission Analysis shows the many benefits SAP provides to CBP/DHS including:  complete integration of business processes within one system; improved financial statement reporting and internal controls; reduced cycle-time; elimination of duplicate entry; improved data accuracy; single system reporting; enhanced analytical reporting; and compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems.","Three recent legislative mandates that have been implemented to satisfy these requirements are as follows: The Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) is a project of the DHS Unity of Effort Initiative. The goal of the CAS is to standardize appropriations across DHS, increasing comparability and transparency and enhancing strategic decision making.

In May 2014, President Obama signed the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) (P.L. 113-101) into law. Now implemented, the DATA Act makes Federal spending data more accessible, searchable, and reliable. It not only makes it easier to understand how the Federal government spends taxpayer dollars but also serves as a tool for better oversight, data-centric decision-making, and innovation both inside and outside of government. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) lead the government-wide implementation of the DATA Act.  The DATA Act project was completed in October 2016.  For more information on the DATA Act follow this link:  https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/data-act.aspx

The government benefits are: 1) Improved communication capability for border protection and agent safety; 2) Improved operational availability (>90%)/reliability/maintainability (refreshing/updating obsolete equipment); 3) Increased system coverage (innovative technology/increased remote communications capabilities/more RF tower locations); 4) Increased network capacity (improved compliance with NTIA narrowband mandate, foundation for future data/video capability); 5) Increased security (advanced Encryption Standard (AES)); 6) Improved situational awareness (faster incident response); 7) Better interoperability (implementation of P25 standard enabling multi-agency communication capabilities). Externally, these benefits provide same-technology-level tactical communications between government law enforcement/emergency management and external partners, as many external partners currently employ (or plan to) modernized communication capabilities. This leads to faster incident/emergency response times that enable efficient dissemination of information to external government organizations, improved coordination between federal, state/province and local public safety agencies, increased government transparency and accountability. Externally, these benefits provide the ultimate value to U.S. citizens through increased citizen safety/border protection.","The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act earmarked $60M for the modernization of Tactical Communications equipment at CBP. In addition, $10M in BSFIT supplemental funds were dedicated to CBP Tactical Communications - http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/recovery/CBP_Tactical_Communications_Modernization_Program_2009-05-15.pdf. TACCOM directly supports and continues to adhere to basic homeland security mission Secure and Manage Our Borders as revised in the 2014 QHSR Review. CBP is responsible for securing the nations borders against illegal entry of people and goods while facilitating legitimate travel and trade. To support this mission, CBP operates and maintains one of the largest Land Mobile Radio (LMR) tactical voice communications infrastructures in the Federal government. Tactical communications capabilities are essential to coordinating mission activities and protecting the safety of over 46,000 CBP law enforcement agents and officers. Agents and officers operate in remote areas where their radio is often their only communications channel to coordinate activities or summon assistance. By improving coverage, capacity, reliability, and encryption, the modernization effort provides critical communications support to the agents and officers who secure U.S. borders - http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2014-qhsr-final-508.pdf. TACCOM upgrades LMR to P25: DHS 4300A requires that LMR systems comply with P25 security standards. P25 primary objectives promote interoperability among digital/analog LMR equipment used by various levels of Government, support backward compatibility with legacy LMRs, enhance spectrum efficiency, maximize economies of scale. All DHS LMRs must be built on P25-compliant platforms or be capable of interfacing with P25-compliant platforms to ensure that DHS requirements can be satisfied - https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-4300a-sensitive-systems-handbook, and TACCOM addresses the NTIA narrowband mandate  https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/manual-regulations-and-procedures-federal-radio-frequency-management-redbook.

ATS is a web-based enforcement and decision support tool that uses intelligence info and technology to target suspect inbound and outbound shipments for exams and passengers for inspection. ATS allows CBP officers to focus their efforts on cargo shipments and passengers consistent with current threats. ATS standardizes names, addresses, ship names, and similar data so these data elements can be more easily associated with other business data to form a more complete picture of passengers, imports and/or exports in context with previous behavior of the parties involved. Every passenger and shipment processed through ATS is subject to a real-time risk evaluation. Risk assessment strategies are multi-tiered in their approach and are founded on complex statistical studies, data analyses, and rules based on knowledge engineering. ATS goals are to serve the DHS Mission of Secure and Manage our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts continues to provide significant benefit to the public. ATS provides selectivity and target capability to support CBP inspection and enforcement activities. As volumes of data increase in people, cargo, and conveyances, officers require increasingly efficient access to more relevant real-time info on which to base critical admission decisions.  The ATS systems address data quality improvements to ensure efforts are focused on only those persons and cargo that present most probable threats to the homeland.  The beneficiaries and key customers of ATS are: CBP Officers and Analysts, the CBP National Targeting Center, CBP Office of Field Operations, CBP Office of International Trade, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Public. Stakeholders include: DHS/CBP (OFO and OIT). ATS utilizes information received from TECS, APIS, and other systems identified in the Enterprise Architecture tab. ATS analyzes over 17M transactions per day for potential threats.  Total ATS passengers and cargo systems maintain 99% uptimes.  Additionally, ATS scans over 150 million Air, Ocean, Rail, Truck, and Auto shipments for potential threats.

However, ATS continues to provide a significant ROI by streamlining the processing of passengers and cargo while increasing the likelihood of identifying threats to the Homeland (e.g., narcotics or weapons). ATS has no DME funding and has been operational since 2004. ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by providing risk data on passengers and cargo. Hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and passengers provide officers and agents valuable info for a potential action. This is an invaluable resource capability. ATS also continues to provide quality data by working with other government agencies to eliminate derogatory matches and potential threats that are deemed false positives. ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characteristics provide information that assists in better targeting efforts.   
   
ATS provides significant benefits through various applications and models. One example is the Air Express Intellectual Property Rights model within ATS which has captured over $757 million dollars (street value) worth of goods from March 2013 to June 2017.  This is one example of the multiple models in production within ATS.

By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a significant benefit to the public. ATS helps secure lawful trade and travel which is vital for national security and public safety.  Governmentally, ATS utilizes system engineering techniques to maintain a system of systems capability throughout its components. ATS provides stakeholders valuable information to target and capture potential threats. ATS is used as a source system to target threats and provide the useful information to boots on the ground teams that can then make an informed decision on a passenger or cargo event. Users receive critical information from hotlists produced on individuals and cargo that present targeted threats to the homeland.

ATS provides critical targeting capabilities that allow targeters in the field to evaluate threats at a much faster rate and interdict when applicable.  This provides additional security and prevention of potential terrorist activity at the border and ports of entry.  ATSs predictive models deliver machine learning and faster analysis of critical intelligence information.  Additionally, passenger and cargo targeting efforts have been augmented with several name matching algorithms that reduce the number of false positives. This also reduces the amount of time for vetting thus saving analysts time and allowing them to focus efforts on more critical threats.  This helps to better secure the US borders.

ACE delivers these capabilities in a secure, paper-free, web environment. ACE has fulfilled Executive Order 13659, which mandated the creation of a Single Window, known as the International Trade Data System (ITDS).  ACE is the system through which the Single Window is realized.  ACE/ITDS is the primary means by which agencies with trade-related responsibilities will receive from users the standard set of data and other relevant documentation required for the release of imported cargo and the clearance of cargo for export. These capabilities/mandates align to the DHS mission of Securing and Managing our Borders.  
  
A key goal of ACE is to modernize functionality from two legacy systems, the Automated Commercial System (ACS) and the Automated Export System (AES). AES has already been successfully retired and its functionality subsumed by ACE in 2014. ACE has modernized several capabilities from ACS, including Cargo Release, Entry Summary, and Manifest processing capabilities.
  
ACE provides considerable benefits to its stakeholders. This includes the enhanced targeting of high-risk shipments and automation, enabling CBP to process cargo faster.

It is used to review air, sea, train, and limited bus passengers and crew in an effort to identify possible terrorists, uncover high-risk individuals, and facilitate the clearance process for legitimate travelers. 
 
The goal of APIS is to facilitate clearance of valid travelers, who are not appearing on watch lists. Commercial/private carriers and aircraft provide APIS information from the biographic information found in the travel documents before traveler boarding of commercial/private vessels and aircraft. The information is then transmitted to CBP prior to departure. It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. 
 
Current benefits of APIS includes matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance. APIS currently collects inbound and outbound data for air and sea passengers; converts to World Customs Organization standards to transmit and acquire data; processes Canadian and Mexican APIS data for passengers traveling from overseas. Electronic APIS (eAPIS) and Electronic Notice of Arrival/Departure (eNOA/D) are web-based functions that allow air carriers and vessels operating without advance departure control systems to transmit data electronically to CBP. Small/medium air carriers can upload data to CBP, acknowledge receipt of data to carriers, and allow carriers to view and request performance reports.
 
APIS supports mission delivery by screening the information against law enforcement databases containing lookout records from many agencies and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify travelers who are a threat tonational security and should not be allowed to travel, and target travelers who need additional inspection upon arrival at a Port of Entry (POE).

It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. APIS data is critical to CBP biographical entry/exit systems.  APIS is the single best method by which CBP obtains advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  The apprehension of the Times Square Bomber is the most visible recent example in that APIS alerted CBP that the bomber was attempting to flee the country and where he could be apprehended.

The computerized analysis of inbound and outbound passengers dramatically increases the efficiency of analysis of high risk traveler identification, as well as, facilitation of low risk passenger traffic. Within the APIS, the development of the eAPIS automated report generation module has significantly reduced the time Account Managers spend on processing APIS sufficiency reports. Several of the APIS KPPs shows how APIS has reduced the time and increased accuracy to process all APIS Queries.","APIS fulfilled the mission needs outlined in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, The Acts require commercial air and sea carriers to electronically transmit arrival and departure manifests for each commercial vessel or aircraft prior to arrival at or departure from the US. This includes matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance. APIS supports mission delivery by screening the information against law enforcement databases containing lookout records from many agencies and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify travelers who are a threat to national security and should not be allowed to travel, and target travelers who need additional inspection upon arrival at a Port of Entry. APIS facilitates clearance of valid travelers, i.e., those not appearing on watch lists. APIS is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various Watch Lists.

APISs aligns to the QHSR (Quadrennial Homeland Security Review) 2.1 goal to Secure US Air, Land and Sea Boarders and Approaches. APIS meets this requirement by reviewing passengers and crew to identify possible terrorists or other high-risk individuals. This helps identify threats versus non threats. Commercial/private carriers and aircraft provide APIS information from the biographic information found in the travel documents before traveler boarding of commercial/private vessels and aircraft. The information is then transmitted to CBP prior to departure. It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists.",yes,yes,,,Jennifer J.

The goals of the Program are to procure, deploy and maintain Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) technology, at and between Ports of Entry, to enable CBPs border security mission without impacting legitimate trade and traffic. Current priorities of the program are to maintain or improve NII examination rates across vectors, while offering efficiencies and increased ability for officers to identify anomalies in conveyances.  To do this, current projects are focused on identifying solutions which address four primary capability gaps: (1) aging technology, (2) stand-alone technology, (3) data-networking and integration, and (4) lack of radiation scanning in the rail environment.
 
In FY 2016 CBP conducted 6.4million exams, resulting in over 2600 narcotic seizures, with a total weight of more than 355,000 pounds. These systems are viewed as force multipliers, with tremendous economic impact. For example, the average NII system examination of a cargo container takes approximately 8 minutes, while a manual inspection takes, on average, 2 hours. This approach expedites trade without sacrificing security, while also minimizing costs. CBP estimates that NII technology provides an annual workforce saving/avoidance of approximately 7,000+ additional CBP officers. Key customers of the Program are CBP Field Offices and the CBP frontline officers and Border Patrol agents who operate the NII technologies. Key stakeholders of the Program include Congressional Committees with a focus on, but not limited to, Homeland/Transportation/Border/Maritime Securityand Appropriations; OMB; DHS - Science & Technology, U.S. Coast Guard, and CBP; General Services Administration; Trade Community; Port Authorities and Terminal Operators; and original equipment manufacturers and service support providers of NII technologies. Other beneficiaries include U.S. citizens; individuals traveling to the U.S.; R&D communities seeking to advance imaging and detection capabilities; and international communities with similar inspection and detection technology or operations.",024-042,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","The calculated ROI for the NII program shows a net return of 123.4% based on a net present value (NPV) analysis in the initial Alternatives Analysis.  Since that analysis, the NII Program has reached ADE-3 and is procuring and deploying the technology as planned.  The performance of the deployed NII technology supports the previously estimated ROI, and is achieving the projected benefits (internal and external; and quantitative and qualitative benefits)
 
The NII Program provides internal and external benefits that are quantified and used to calculate the ROI.  Internally, NII systems reduce the time to conduct a manual exam by over 93 percent; an NII exam takes 8 minutes and a manual exam takes 120 minutes. To quantify this reduction: over 20 million vessel and truck containers with a market value of about $1.5 trillion annually enter the United States at and between POEs. Of these containers, NII large-scale technology is used to inspect approximately 10 percent of the targeted vessel and truck containers (about 2 million containers). Without using NII technology, the same number of exams would take an additional 3.8 million man-hours or approximately 7,000 additional CBP officers. NII systems also provide operational benefits spanning personnel safety, speed, and accuracy of detection.
 
From an external perspective, the expedited inspection process - made possible with NII technologies - saves the trade industry an estimated 0.5-percent to 1.5-percent increase to the cost of goods that would be created if manual inspections were performed. This is cost avoidance to the trade industry of approximately $5.8 billion to $17.5 billion per year. This cost is based on a parametric estimate using current literature on the cost of transit time for the delivery of goods. While NII technology offers exceptional deterrence benefits at and between the Nations POEs, the greatest qualitative external benefit of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism. Through the use of NII equipment CBP has increased the number of and the quality of cargo inspections which decreases the probability that WMD or other instruments of terrorism will enter the U.S.","The Program will provide efficient and effective technological capabilities to interdict and detect illegal weapons, contraband and people arriving at the U.S. borders without affecting trade or travel.

Benefits include mission efficiency and effectiveness, as well as Border Patrol safety. More specifically, the IFT system provides the Border Patrol the capability of continuously detecting Items of Interest (IoIs) from a tested range of 6.2 miles and identifying/classifying each from a tested range of 6.8 miles from each fixed tower within a Border Patrol Stations Area of Coverage (AoC). The system provides the Common Operating Picture (COP) operator(s) at the Border Patrol Station Command and Control Center with near real-time video of operator-selected IoIs of sufficient quality to enable a trained operator to identify and classify the IoI. IoI data from one or more IFT units across the AoC will be shown geospatially on one or more COP workstations that also display the video of operator-selected IoIs. This will allow the COP operator to track and communicate the location and number of IoIs to Border Patrol Agents in the field, thus allowing the USBP to monitor an Area of Interest (AoI) with fewer agents and equipment resources.

Compared to the baseline operating costs from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the RVSS operating costs are estimated to be considerably lower. ROI calculation: [(Baseline Operating Costs {with agents only} minus RVSS Upgrade Operating Costs) divided by the Capital Investment Cost], minus 1 providing the same level of surveillance.

The key internal benefit is that for a lower overall operating cost, the investment will provide the USBP with a persistent surveillance capability, which will enable them to detect, identify, and track Items of Interests (IoIs), thus enabling them to monitor an Area of Interest more efficiently and effectively. Other benefits include: facilitate mission accomplishments; allow agents to be re-aligned since it acts as a force multiplier; agents will be safer since fewer will be required in the field for surveillance; technology will be used only in areas in which it performs well; and improved data will be available (recorded video imagery) for successful law enforcement accomplishment versus the baseline.

Additional benefits include maintaining low logistics support costs, a minimal number of trouble tickets, a high operational availability, a low number of priority 1 downtime events, and a low number of priority 2 and 3 corrective actions. 

External Benefits: The program could result in indirect and long-term beneficial impacts by reducing the adverse impacts of illegal cross-border violator activities in the project area.  The RVSS towers would enhance CBPs detection and threat classification capabilities and increase the efficiency of operational activities within the area of tower coverage.  Over time the enhancement of detection capabilities and an increase in operational efficiency could increase the deterrence of illegal cross-border violator activity within the area of tower coverage.

Planned Outcomes: The intended mission outcomes are three-fold (1) Increase situational awareness provided on the Southwest Border while leveraging the added range potential of cameras systems where practical. (2) Replace the current analog system with a more secure digital system. (3) The RVSS Upgrade is expected to enhance the current mission through early detection of border incursions, through enhanced identification and classification of the threat, and through an improved ability to track items of interest.","The RVSS Program supports the following two requirements (as cited in the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (Link: https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2014-qhsr-final-508.pdf);

Current benefits of BPES: 1) Improved Information Sharing and Managementenables the automatic collection, dissemination and analysis of critical asset and personnel data, improving USBPs situational awareness and the identification of resources to improve border enforcement and security through resource prioritization. 2) Improved System and Process Integrationsupports new innovative approaches to exchange information and integrate USBP technology. These efforts help USBP develop efficient day-to-day processes for agents, and reduce operational costs by providing timely information across various CBP systems. 3) Rapid Response Abilityenables USBP to gain greater situational awareness, using sensors along the border, to support rapid response to interdict those crossing the border illegally.  

Key stakeholders/customers/beneficiaries: 1) Internal CBP: USBP, Office of Field Operations (OFO), Office of Acquisition (OA), Air and Marine Operations (AMO), and Office of Intelligence (OI); 2) Within DHS: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Coast Guard (USCG),Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Science and Technology (S&T), Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS); 3) External to DHS: US Department of Justice (DOJ), US Department of Defense (DOD), Department of State (DOS), White House, Congress, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Government Accountability Office (GAO), Inspectors General (IG); 4) External to the federal government: general public, state and local governments, foreign governments (e.g, Canadian and Mexican governments).",024-042,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","USBP, CBP, other DHS Components (e.g., ICE, CIS, USCG, FEMA, S&T), other federal agencies (e.g., DOJ, DOS and DOD), state, local and foreign governments benefit from BPES by having access to shared information that heighten situational awareness and risk-based decision-making, thereby reducing operational costs while addressing their missions quickly and effectively. BPES captures information on criminal prosecution activities, facilitating court submissions to DOJ. It also provides real-time border surveillance and monitoring of agent activity and officer safety used by law enforcement. BPES provides workforce staffing information and tracks operational metrics linked with DHS, the FBI and ICE. This integration improves decision-making and supports the rapid deployment of USBP resources while reducing operational costs. BPES provides statistical reports that CBP and multiple DHS components (e.g., FEMA, ICE, CIS) use for strategic and tactical decision-making. It enables USBP to provide reliable statistical information in response to White House, Congress, OMB, GAO, IG, IA and other federal agency requirements, including those of the Departments of State and Justice. State governments, such as the State of Texas, and foreign governments, such as the Governments of Canada, Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala also use information. 
 
BPES is a consolidated investment in the sustainment phase, so a CBA--which would contain a return on investment (ROI)--is not required.","BPES fulfills the requirements of the following laws: 
1) Immigration and Nationality Act (1965) which bases immigration rules to a preference system focused on immigrants' skills and family relationships. BPES supports this act by providing ICE access to databases to ensure legal border entries. http://library.uwb.edu/static/usimmigration/1965_immigration_and_nationality_act.html 
2) Border Protection Agent Pay Reform Act (BPAPRA) (2014) which provides a new method of compensating USBP agents for overtime work. This law affects only USBP agents in CBP. BPES complied with BPAPRA in January 2016, enabling USBP agents to enter their overtime pay and obtain compensation based on the new approach. https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1691/text 
3) Flores Agreement (1997) provides guidance on the treatment of Unaccompanied Children (UAC). e3, a BPES system that manages processing and prosecution of all apprehended subjects, ensures compliance to stated guidelines. https://lirs.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Flores-Family-Detention-Backgrounder-LIRS-WRC-KIND-FINAL1.pdf 
4) FITARA (2014) requires increased CIO visibility in budget formulation, planning, acquisition and execution. BPES is working on ensuring alignment with the federal budget process and providing more detailed and accurate data, as required. BPES complied with the recent DHS CIO data call on planned IT Expenditure Reporting. BPES recently completed a detailed Current Program Estimate (CPE), built from the ground up and with inputs from a vast array of BPES stakeholders. The CPE is an important input to the BY18 BPES Business Case. Moreover, it will be a living document from which future BPES Resource Allocation Plans will be developed. https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1232
