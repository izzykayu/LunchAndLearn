HSIN is the only federal portal that provides information sharing among DHS and its partners across the full spectrum of homeland security missions. HSIN's key customers and stakeholder are comprised of Federal, state and local officials engaged in emergency management, immigration control, fire services, emergency medical services, law enforcement and a number of specific homeland security missions. The HSIN system groups key customers and stakeholders into Communities of Interest (COIs) so that coordination and collaboration can occur within specific mission areas. HSIN benefits its customer base through the provision of (1) a nationwide information exchange platform, (2) in a secure environment (3) where only trusted partners have access to separate knowledge space, (4) where document uploading and storage is enabled, (5) where real-time screen sharing collaboration is available, (6) with secure email messaging capability and (7) secure chat capability. HSIN users require the capability to share information horizontally and vertically across diverse mission areas in a network of trust. Users gain uniform access to critical information through HSIN's nationwide secure gateway and interoperability with selected trusted platforms.  Through HSIN, customers/users gain access to timely and accurate information related to detecting, preventing, responding, and recovering from terrorist attacks and natural disasters; information regarding vulnerabilities and threats; information related to incident management to mitigate risks and reduce post incident loss of life and property;  and information related to emergency management response and recovery operations. HSIN connects disparate information users in a dynamic and diverse information exchange environment.","024-001 : Analysis and Operations","HSIN is the only federal portal that provides information sharing and safeguarding among DHS and its partners across the full spectrum of homeland security missions, to include: intelligence and warning; border and transportation security, defending against catastrophic threats; protecting critical infrastructure and key assets; and emergency preparedness and response. HSIN stakeholders are comprised of Federal, state and local officials engaged in emergency management, immigration control, fire services, emergency medical services, law enforcement and a number of specific homeland security missions. HSIN provides a number of information sharing services to include uploading and storage of documents through its SharePoint application; screen sharing collaboration through Adobe Connect; secure email messaging capability; and secure chat capability.  HSIN groups users into Communities of Interest (COIs) so that coordination can occur within specific mission areas. Users gain uniform access to critical information through HSIN's nationwide secure gateway and interoperability with selected trusted platforms.  Global Federal Identify Privilege Management (GFIPM) provides the standard for interoperability between agencies that enables federated single-sign-on and federated search across the interagency federation. Consolidation opportunities have been identified. Changes to the architecture deliver the following improvements and enhancements: (1) Improved account management through registration, enrollment, and provisioning; (2) Strong Authentication with single-sign on and multi-factor authentication; (3) Identity Proofing to validate user identities using personal and financial records; (4) Storing of credentials securely through a flexible attribute exchange model. In addition to the innovation above, HSIN is directly involved with Enterprise EA, facilitating establishing the target EA Architecture. HSIN's engagement within the IdAM target architecture is part of the Identity First strategy that is being undertaken with in the PM-ISE/CUI-SBU Working group.  HSIN's role is helping to define the current state of how identity is being implemented today and outlining the to-be state that will include a Federated architecture that is based upon NIEF/GFIPM .","The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) is a DHS Mission Critical system for national situational awareness and collaboration that enables Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) information sharing and analysis.  This capability is critical to both day-to-day operational decision making and successful execution of large-scale emergency operations. HSIN is the only federal portal that provides information sharing among DHS and its Federal, State, local, territorial, tribal, international, and private sector partners across the full spectrum of homeland security missions.  Additionally, HSIN facilitates information sharing and coordination across all DHS mission areas and supports Communities of Interest in Emergency Management, Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources, Law Enforcement, Intelligence, and the DHS relationship with the Department of Defense.  In fulfillment of its mission, HSIN delivers on the promises of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act and the Department's Information Sharing Environment to innovate and deploy new approaches and tools to effectively share, discover, fuse, and enable timely action on terrorism-related information. HSIN recently saw unprecedented use prompted by the response to the Boston Marathon incident in April 2013. Additionally, HSIN was used extensively in special events planning prior to and during the Super Bowl in New Jersey and in the JFK 50th Anniversary Commemoration in Dallas.  Although Mission Critical, it is very difficult to measure the tangible benefits of HSIN supporting DHS's mission. There is an ongoing DHS initiative that has and will result in DHS cost savings - SBU Portal Consolidation.  HSIN is designated as the DHS SBU information sharing portal and 17 portals have been identified for potential consolidation onto HSIN.  OMB has endorsed this DHS SBU portal consolidations Initiative.  The portal consolidation (planned and completed) will produce an estimated cost savings exceeding $49 million through 2020, net present value. Although the savings is significant, HSIN's return of investment (ROI) is not measured in dollars, but in lives saved, acts of terrorism prevented, law enforcement actions conducted and serious incidents managed and mitigated.","HSIN achieved FOC in March 2014; increased the number of HSIN users by about 9,000 in the past year (19,000 in September 2013 to over 27,000 in June); developed new Federation capabilities and new Single Sign-on capabilities; and consolidated segments of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) portal onto HSIN.","HSIN's Current Year (FY 15) objectives are to develop enhanced HSIN capabilities for users; execute Portal Consolidation for designated portals; develop enhanced Federation and Single Sign-on capabilities; and continue to provide current HSIN customers with an exceptional information sharing platform. For Portal Consolidation, the program plans to consolidate specific segments of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center portal, under a project known as FLETC Portal Consolidation Phase III; complete the Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation (FLETA) portal consolidation started earlier in FY14; and consolidate the CBP Collaboration Network onto HSIN. The HSIN Program will continue to work  with the U.S. Coast Guard to assess which segments of the Homeport system that might be ready for consolidation onto HSIN. For Federation, the program plans to develop PIV Federation capability for other Federal, State and Local agencies. The HSIN Program also plans to develop Single Sign-on capabilities for a number of Fusion Center applications. During the out years (FY 17-21), HSIN will continue to develop new capabilities based on our broad user base. The program will also continue to seek out portal consolidation opportunities in order to realize a cost saving of up to $49,000,000 over the life of the program. HSIN's ultimate goal is to serve as DHS's premier platform in information sharing throughout the DHS mission community.","yes","yes","no","yes","yes","yes","yes","no","","no","259.002000","24.243000","27.075000","27.862000","2004","2020","Changes to meet emerging security requirements, interoperability and hosting services in the DHS data centers.","The non-developmental work is centered on Operations & Maintenance and Level of Effort support work, including program management, training, performance, capital planning and investment control, and customer stakeholder engagement activities, for which EVM is not applicable.

An outcome of this investment is that COP stakeholders such as the White House, DHS Secretary and Deputy Secretary, DHS operations leadership as well as other key staff at the Federal, State, tribal, and local levels receive consistent, timely and accurate reports of critical information for events of national/international significance. Stakeholders will receive data from multiple vetted sources increasing the integrity and reliability of the data. The most important outcome of the COP investment is that the situational awareness information it provides to stakeholders allows them to make informed decisions in a timely manner.","024-001 : Analysis and Operations","The DHS COP meets the agency's target architecture as defined in the EA Roadmap.  COP continues to drive component COP architecture across all components that fall under this investment.","Prior to implementation, there was no real-time shared situational awareness tool.  Every component operations center maintained their own version of what was important and what was current.  At best, these updates were consolodated twice a day.  Components would update serially, thier status to the NOC.  This was labor intensive, error prone, and the informaiton it provided was outdated.  The DHS COP provides situational awareness capability that is utilized by the NOC and is now supporting decision-makers such as the White House, DHS Secretary and Deputy Secretary, DHS operations leadership as well as other key staff at the federal, state, tribal, and local levels. COP stakeholders are benefiting by receiving consistent, timely and accurate reporting of critical information for events of national/international significance.

GD is required to do earned value management (EVM) on the development piece of its contract.  However, the O&M portion of the contract is treated as level of effort and does not require EVM.  The program management effort led by Blackstone Technology does not require EVM due to the small annual dollar value contributed to OPS CIO Program Management Support by the COP investment.  The new COP Technology Refresh contract awarded in Q4 FY09 will require EVM. In January 2006, DHS established policy that all contracts contain wording pertaining to EV, EVM and the use of an EVMS. The Homeland Security Acquisition Manual (HSAM) Subchapter 3034.2 (updated December 2006) established the requirement for using EVM on efforts in development based on contract size and risk.  Based on the stage and type of the SPAWAR and Blackstone Technology contracts, as well as budgetary implications, implementing EVM would provide little value and would neither be cost effective nor informative. In light of plans to let a contract under EAGLE, the COP Program Manager in place met with the DHS EVM Subject Matter Expert (SME) regarding DHS EVM requirements.  The SME agreed that the current state of the contract did not warrant EVM. Further, in FY08 Q1, following review by the OPS CIO, development on the current COP system ceased.  The remaining non-developmental work is centered on Operations & Maintenance and Level of Effort support work, including program management, training, performance, capital planning and investment control, and customer stakeholder engagement activities, for which EVM is not applicable. These non-developmental activities fall under a Time & Materials contract with Blackstone Technology Group.  As stated in the Acquisition Plan, the COP Technology Refresh will be procured under EAGLE, which has a clear ANSI/EIA-748 EVM mandate.  Per the EAGLE Guide, DHS OPS will use EVM to monitor development tasks under the new contract and the contractor will be required to provide monthly EVM information that meets the criteria defined in ANSI/EIA-748.","2","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Analysis & Operations (A&O) Common Operating Picture (COP) program is in the Mixed life cycle phase. Inaccurate reporting reflects the program's cost and schedule variances outside OMB acceptable thresholds.  Consequently, this will require a re-baseline of activities. The program also continues to be understaffed, which has negatively impacted program performance. Program leadership is working to reacquire manpower to adequately staff the program. Program leadership is currently working on an operational analysis (OA). The OA is expected to be approved during the next review cycle.

The mission is to support the system upgrades and improvements of ERO's business processes for the detention and removal of illegal aliens from the United States.  A major goal accomplished was the replacement of the legacy case management system, the Deportable Alien Control System (DACS), with a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based system.  Other goals focus on streamlining the throughput of detainees to reduce the length of detention, promote interagency partnerships through information sharing, and streamline the overall business operations by leveraging the existing Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/ICE application infrastructure.  Key enhancements include faster data access, improved data exchange and sharing, tighter interoperability among ERO systems, improved detainee tracking, and improved forecasting and trends analysis with real-time reporting.  DROM ensures that ERO has the necessary automation solutions to continue their effort to enforce immigration laws.  DROM solutions support other ICE enforcement initiatives by identifying and processing alien offenders and inmates in state and local law enforcement custody. Stakeholders of this investment include the ICE OCIO, ICE ERO, and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) Office of the Border Patrol. The Investment's primary users include ERO agents, detention facility administrators, and ICE headquarters personnel.  Additionally, DROM improved data sharing and exchange with other DHS and law enforcement components, including CBP and Office of Field Operations, Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations, State Department, and Central Intelligence Agency.    In 2009 the Department's implementation of a new series of immigration detention reform initiatives required a quick response to deliver automation tools to meet ERO's evolving business needs.  Its focus on addressing challenges in detainee tracking, bed-space management, and transportation management shifted to specific reform initiatives such as detention alternatives, improved detention management through risk assessment and custody classification, and improved accountability and transparency to promote the health and safety of detainees.","024-047 : Enforcement and Removal Operations","The projects in the Detention and Removal Operations Modernization (DROM) investment deliver capabilities that help align it with the law enforcement segment / functional area in the target EA. The following core capabilities demonstrate how DROM contributes to the DHS EA segment of law enforcement:          Removals management includes detainee case processing from apprehension through detention and removals (e.g., awaiting credible fear review, detainee risk classification, custody alternatives, immigration adjudication, awaiting travel document issuance)        Real-time reporting, information sharing, and performance metrics for events from arrest through detention and removal.    The investment includes a collection of web applications built using iterative methodology, delivering core business functionality, that are interoperable via the use of services and messaging frameworks. This solution currently provides a streamlined removals capability to the business unit bringing under its umbrella a variety of business processes such as detention management, removals management, bond management etc. The detainee risk classification capability early in the case processing chain leads to a programmatic innovation that helps ICE agents make decisions regarding a detainee's custody.","DROM conducts operations to identify and apprehend removable aliens, to detain these individuals when necessary, and to remove illegal aliens from the United States. DROM prioritizes the apprehension, arrest, and removal of convicted criminals, those who pose a threat to national security, fugitives, recent border entrants, and aliens who impede immigration controls. DROM has implemented a centralized system (EARM) where detention and deportation officers are able to rely on one integrated system to facilitate repatriation. The ROI including internal and external benefits for the DROM Program are time savings for reduced intake process, time and cost savings for electronic transmission of travel documents, and cost savings for bond processing (e.g. travel expenses) by allowing officers to use the information system versus traveling to surety offices nationwide to issue bonds for detainees.","New EARM capabilities included:  improved workflow with eBonds, new automated EADM forms, increased search capability to improve search quality and efficiency, and enhancement to the user interface for quicker booking and administrative procedures when working with case files.  This resulted in improved workflow, enhanced logic features, and new reporting capabilities to facilitate rapid data analysis.  Also, ported the functions of Fugitive Case Management System (FCMS) into EARM.  This enhancement reduces future deployment and maintenance costs for FCMS and integrates the project into the overarching ICE ERO enterprise business model, provide better real-time integration and compatibility with EARM and ENFORCE Integrated Database (EID), and improve data quality and integrity.  Information that agents retrieve will be more accurate, current, and relevant to the investigation as well as more readily accessible, better enabling them to locate and remove fugitives.","In CY, the program team will dispose of FCMS and all other applications will operate in the support phase.

Additional improvements include new capabilities in scheduling and workflow, standardization/oversight of health care practices, clinical management, credentialing/privileging of medical providers, tracking resolution of medical grievances, intra-/inter-agency exchange of Continuity of Care Record/Continuity of Care Document (CCR/CCD) medical information, master medication list management, clinical decision support, standardized role- or disease/care-based reports, providing the capability to initiate facility enterprise medical alerts, measurement of contract medical compliance, off-line documentation capability of remote services, emergency response/evacuations, flight operations, and work site enforcements, coordination between medical and non-medical staff, reporting on Government Accountability Office (GAO) topics including most common illnesses, significant detainee illnesses and compliance analysis, health record data centralization, overall medical data interoperability, and the ability to view centralized data from legacy systems.","The eHR will benefit O&M by replacing manual, paper-based processes and stand-alone IT systems with a unified medical record for all IHSC facilities. An eHR solution will focus on providing solutions to the IHSC functional operation area. These improvements, in comparison to the baseline, result in cost avoidance - the basis for determining eHR benefits.The current operation's environment results in the following:* Greater percent of time spent providing medical support services versus medical services. Examples include:o Repeated documentation of detainee information.o Significant time spent tracking down detainee records.* Repeat delivery of medical services (i.e., X-rays).* Time spent reading and interpreting provider hand written notes.* Long lead time providing decision support (reports and queries). Significant time is spent on the following process:o Tracking down and collecting paper records.o Extracting detainee medical record data and entering data into decision support product (i.e., Microsoft Excel).o Analyzing data with inconsistencies.The eHR To-Be operational environment will provide:* Improved provider efficiency based on the number of encounters per provider per quarter;* Reduction in the non-compliance of key medical activities due while in custody;* Improved notification to immigration case managers regarding medical alerts, medical holds, special needs, and medication status on each detainee;* Elimination of existing reports based on hand-tallying, individual paper workload documentation, and medical record reviews;* Accountability and coordination of all activities required by all detainees in custody;* Reduction in medication errors throughout the order, fulfillment, and delivery of medications to ICE detainees;* Industry-based workload factors on all system activities to align staffing with activity workload;* Improved identification and communication of preliminary (reported, historical, etc.) and certified medical conditions; and  * Improved reporting of infectious disease to appropriate public health authorities (state, federal) and to stakeholders (Congress, Government Accountability Office (GAO), etc.).  As documented in the eHR CBA, the greatest cost avoidance is provided by Clinical Support by reducing current status quo cost by 32% annually. Overall, 36% of current costs will be avoided.  The decreased O&M will recover all of the acquisition costs in approximately five years.","During the PY, the core eHR was installed in an FOC at all IHSC staffed facilities.

The goal of SEVIS is to track information on nonimmigrants who are participating in the U.S. education system or designated exchange visitor program throughout the duration of their approved stay. Nonimmigrants may temporarily come to the US to study under three classes of admission: F for academic and language students, M for vocational students, and J for exchange visitors. SEVIS greatly improved efficiencies by using electronic means to capture critical F/M/J nonimmigrant information in a centralized repository. The use of the SEVIS electronic system increases data accuracy, reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information, improves the experience of school/program officials and nonimmigrants, and significantly increases data sharing across multiple government agencies reducing duplication of effort. Efficiencies are further improved through the ability of the web-based SEVIS application to be used in real-time for data updates and queries which reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information. SEVIS supports the DHS Mission by providing critical information needed to enforce immigration laws. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) within the ICE Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is the business sponsor that funds and manages SEVIS. SEVIS also supports the Department of State (DoS) Office of Private Sector Exchange in its mission. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides IT program and project management support to SEVP. Stakeholders include DHS ICE and DoS government users; customers are users from the academia and programs sponsoring F, M, or J status nonimmigrants; nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors and their dependents. In addition, SEVIS shares data with agencies' and organizations' systems including, DoS Consular Consolidated Database (CCD), USCIS Electronic Immigration System (ELIS), Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF), Department of Treasury I-901 Fee Pay system, Student and Exchange Visitor Program Automated Management System (SEVPAMS), CBP TECS, Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS).","024-048 : Homeland Security Investigations","SEVIS is being incrementally enhanced to overcome technical / programmatic limitations in the current system, but is constrained to be developed under the O&M Phase using current infrastructure and DHS-approved functionalities per the Acquisition Decision Memorandum of 14 February, 2013. During this enhancement effort, ICE will attempt to bring SEVIS into better alignment with the ICE target EA while identifying capabilities within the enterprise that can be leveraged during the modernization. The system will also be designed to allow reuse of its core components where appropriate value has been identified.","SEVIS is currently the only system designed to identify how many students and exchange visitors are in the United States, what they are doing, where they are located, whether they are participating in Optional Practical Training, or are Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics students.  Previously a paper based process, SEVIS implementation provided efficiencies by using electronic means to capture critical F/M/J nonimmigrant information in a centralized repository. The use of the SEVIS electronic system increases data accuracy, reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information, and improves the experience of school/program officials and nonimmigrants. SEVIS has continued to add value in the support phase. One of SEVP's missions is to strengthen the U.S. by building cross-cultural ties and attracting highly talented students and scholars. During the life of SEVIS, enhancements have been made to help facilitate the process required for foreign students and scholars coming to the United States and to minimize a perception that the United States is discouraging foreign students and scholars from coming to the U.S. These enhancements include ensuring that data is accurate so nonimmigrants are not denied a visa or entry based on incorrect information and ensuring that there are processes to quickly correct inaccurate data. Foreign student enrollment plateaued prior to and during the initial deployment of SEVIS. Between 2006 and 2012 the number of foreign students has doubled and continues to grow. Government users have also come to recognize the value of SEVIS data. A primary example is the timely data that SEVIS provides CBP, which supports CBP officers at U.S. ports of entry in making information-based decisions on granting entry for F, M, and J nonimmigrants. For the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF) and the ICE Compliance Enforcement Unit (CEU), SEVIS has similarly become an essential tool for national security.","ICE 1) Implemented Agile development for Operations & Maintenance (O&M) and approved functional area enhancements coding in accordance with ADM-1, 2) awarded new O&M contracts to reduce O&M costs by 25%, 3) Issued a release allowing schools to enter accreditation & Federal Aviation Administration certification information, search using the SEVIS ID, more easily correct zip codes, adjust user roles to reduce data correction requests & increase the accuracy of school and student information, 4) Acquired contract support & commenced closing vulnerabilities as approved by DHS, 5) Acquired contract support for & made progress on improving the data flow to Customs & Border Protection port of entry officers to improve nonimmigrant entry decisions, 6) Prepared acquisition documentation for the second set of DHS-approved functional area enhancements, 7) migrated to a cloud-based Development/Test environment, and 8) Commenced development of an MNS in response to the 24 February 2014 ADM.","In the Current Year and Budget Year ahead ICE will (1) Recompete the SEVIS IT Planning and Architecture Team contract in an effort to increase efficiency and lower cost, (2) Award the second set of DHS-approved enhancements that will further increase information accuracy, ease the data entry into SEVIS, provide better help and instructional text on-screen, make SEVIS data more suitable to analysis for historical events and anomalous activity, and provide workflows to support nonimmigrant students transferring between schools, (3) Release the initial DHS-approved enhancements into production, (4) Release the CBP admissibility indicator into production, (5) Continue to improve SEVIS with O&M releases, (6) Develop and submit an MNS for DHS review and approval, and when the MNS is approved, (7) execute an Analysis of Alternatives to determine the solution set to close the remaining SEVIS vulnerabilities.","yes","yes","no","no","yes","no","no","no","","no","259.121000","22.568000","14.002000","14.347000","2002","2020","N/A."," All contracts are Firm Fixed Price with set monthly billing amounts.

PTS maintains alignment with the HLSEA and FEA reference models as demonstrated in the EA section and the Exhibit 53. PTS is implemented wholly within the public/commercial telecommunication networks hence no service or capability is deployed within the DHS enterprise.  HLSEA target architecture and enterprise roadmap do not apply to the PTS program because PTS does not implement any capabilities within the scope of the HLSEA.  Technical direction, target architectures, and roadmaps for the commercial service providers are determined independently by their respective organizations and the underlying technical standards upon which their networks are deployed.  PTS fully complies with the DHS Information Resources Management Strategic Plan FY14-18 and is reviewed annually by DHS CIO and updates are provided to IMS.   PTS does actively participate with industry standards development and road mapping to ensure PTS requirements are incorporated in the standards where appropriate.  Additionally, PTS engages the service provider community in the development of Government Industry Requirements (GIRs) for priority services to assure technical innovation adequately addresses the needs of the NS/EP user community.     Currently the commercial service providers are replacing their aging circuit-switched infrastructure with new packet-switched infrastructure.  GIRs for this evolution were developed and the Next Generation Network (NGN) Priority Services investment is implementing these capabilities as a technology insertion to the PTS program. These activities ensure that the capabilities implemented within the commercial / public telecommunication infrastructure benefit of the National Security and Emergency Preparedness and first responder user communities including the President, Congress, Federal, State, local, territorial, and tribal governments, industry partners and other authorized users.","Priority Telecommunications Service (PTS) is provided through service-based contracts with commercial providers.

The NCPS provides a wide range of cyber security capabilities for the Federal Executive Branch government networks (.gov domain), including:  Intrusion detection (passive defense); Intrusion prevention (active defense); Advanced cyber analytics - such as data aggregation & correlation, visualization, malware analysis, and packet capture; Incident Management; and Information sharing and collaboration.  Goals: Improve detection, prevention, and notification of cyber incidents, improve correlation, aggregation and visualization of cybersecurity data, improve information of cybersecurity activity.Current/Anticipated Benefit: This range of capabilities supports US-CERT operations, helps prevent cyber attacks on the .gov domain and reduces the time to respond to and recover from cyber attacks when they occur.Users: The users of the NCPS capability within the Department are US-CERT, and outside the Department are Departments and Agencies (D/A) Security Operations Centers (SOCs).Stakeholders of the NCPS include: Federal executive leadership, Federal Executive Branch civilian Departments and Agencies, tribal, state and local government, law enforcement, private industry, and international partners.","024-014 : Cybersecurity and Communications","The NCPS provides intrusion and detection services to Federal civilian Departments and Agencies (D/As). The NCPS architecture resides outside of the DHS enclave and provides a range of externally deployed cybersecurity sensors and services that are not appropriate for integration with DHS enterprise services. However, the NCPS is developed in a manner that does align with DHS enterprise architecture objectives and NCPS is actively involved in Enterprise Architecture (EA) Integrated Project Teams (IPTs) and follows appropriate roadmaps at the sub-component (CSC EA), component (NPPD EA), and DHS HQ EA levels. The NCPS directly aligns with the IRM Strategic Plan (Version 7.0) and DHS Enterprise Roadmap (Version 7.0) Mission 4: Safeguarding and Securing Cyberspace and in particular Goal 4.2: Promoting Cybersecurity Knowledge and Innovation. One of NCPS' key development initiatives centers around Information Sharing which will benefit Federal civilian agencies inclusive of DHS on being better informed and aware of cybersecurity threats and proper cybersecurity protocol activities that they as agencies can undertake to better protect their networks. NCPS backend systems reside in a separate network enclave since they support the ingestion and analysis of malicious code that could damage DHS networks. Because evolving cybersecurity threats cannot easily be addressed with standard solutions, the NCPS innovation is based on our teaming arrangements with advanced organizations (such as National Laboratories) that are included in Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. These teaming arrangements combined with NCPS contracts that leverage the best available Government-of-the-Shelf (GOTS) and Contractor-of-the-Shelf (COTS) products ensures NCPS is constantly evolving from an innovation standpoint. In addition, the NCPS innovation in itself is that as an investment it provides a more efficient way to have a focal point for managing advanced approaches for cybersecurity for all federal civilian agencies as opposed to having all D/A's conduct their own advanced cybersecurity activities.","The ROI was determined by utilizing an internal tool that was developed to assess costs and benefits related to cybersecurity investment projects that are funded by NSD. The tool was considered a better option than using the Corporate Finance formula as suggested by the DHS Management Program as it provided a more updated approach towards assessing benefits and in addition the tool provides a more advanced capability in estimating the singular contribution of NCPS to the .gov cybersecurity value chain. The program justifies this negative ROI as the NCPS is a capability expansion of services previously not provided for the civilian agencies. The program creates a new capability in providing perimeter defense for Federal Executive Departments and Agencies (D/A) in the .gov domain under the requirements of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI). This perimeter defense provides an overarching layer of cybersecurity by detecting, analyzing, and preventing cyber attacks upon the civilian agency .gov domain. In addition, these services are provided without a reimbursement from the D/As. Because of this, the program may not recover the initial DME. While the overall program is showing negative ROI because the system is providing a cost avoidance service for the .gov domain, the program will likely show improvement in its recovery of initial acquisition costs as Information Sharing projects move from development into operations and as future O&M costs may be reduced based on technological enhancements that make operations and the cost of those operations more efficient.","INTRUSION PREVENTION:  2 ISPs (CTL and VZ) have Nest and Traffic Aggregation services operational, 8 agencies are being provided DNS and/or Email Protection services.

This investment purpose provides a critical enabling tool to the ISCD and fills the gap in non-existing capabilities. It provides for the development and operations of an IT solution for the electronic submission of data and automated data management tools CSAT suite (CSATs). CSATs goal is to deliver a responsive, accurate, consistent method for mass data management, and a dynamic communications tool permitting timely risk assessments of high-risk chemical facilities and regulated facilities implemented security enhancement measures. This investment outcome supports the operational performance of the Chemical Facility Anti-terrorism Standards program benefiting multiple DHS critical mission venues including: (1) The National Coordinator Outcome: Any physical or virtual disruption of the operation of the critical infrastructure of the United States is rare, brief, geographically limited in effect, and minimally detrimental to the economy, provision of governmental services, and national security of the United States. (2) Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) Goal 1.2: Prevent the Unauthorized Acquisition or Use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Materials and Capabilities. (3)  QHSR Goal 1.3: Manage Risks to Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events. And (4) DHS/NPPD FY11 Strategic Activities: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security. Due to the regulatory nature of this investment, the stakeholders and users are the same while their roles and respective access to CSATs features may differ. Stakeholders and users include: Owners and operators of regulated chemical facilities, DHS ISCD headquarters employees and contractors, DHS ISCD inspectors and support staff, and Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies responsible for homeland security and critical infrastructure protection. This investment's benefits are derived from reducing the risk of, or public exposure to, potential terrorist attacks on high-risk chemical facilities that could cause significant numbers of deaths and injuries and disruption of critical sectors within the U.S. economy.","024-013 : Infrastructure Protection","CSAT suite maintains the Department's mission and functional capability for Security by assessing and mitigating risk of the chemical physical infrastructure; as well as responding to the Congressional mandated program and DHS Appropriations Act of 2007 in accordance to the Chemical Facility Anti-terrorism Standards (CFATS).  CSAT suite received a continued as planned decision for Securing Portfolio during the DHS Joint Portfolio Review for 2013.  It delivers capabilities for electronic processing of: User Registration and Management, Consequence and Risk Based Screening, Site Vulnerability Assessments, Site Security Plan Submissions, and Personnel Surety of the potential high risk facilities tied to any of the 321 Chemicals of Interest (COI) identified in the Act's Appendix A.  CSAT suite also delivers reporting capabilities for ammonium nitrate transactions.  CSAT suite eliminates redundant operations, supports programmatic innovation, and realizes cost savings by consolidating its various applications onto a common platform and hosted in a virtualized architecture. The investment completes a transition from two Federal Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) hosting facilities to an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment provided by DHS Enterprise Data Center hosting facility further realizing cost savings. CSAT Suite eliminates the development and use of customized software code and utilizes Case and Relationship Management COTS software in alignment with the DHS Enterprise Roadmap.  The investment's data architecture is consolidated, scaled and standardized to use dynamic data exchange protocols and optimize information sharing and system integration.  The investment satisfies the Paperwork Reduction Act 1995 by achieving technical innovation and bridging the gap in non-existent capabilities; it provides a robust data capture and analysis capability while minimizing the number of dedicated federal employees that would be required for a traditional paper-based regulatory data submission environment.","Electronic data collection provides a more responsive, accurate, and consistent method for mass data management. A properly managed electronic system is capable of scaling readily and easily to meet changing data storage demands; handling very large populations of concurrent users; providing availability regardless of time of day or geographic region of users; and enabling extensive data analysis. A web-enabled electronic submission further provides users with the ability to work collaboratively and supports sharing of timely information between DHS and the regulated community. Furthermore, CSAT electronic data analytics features can be methodically adjusted to either broaden or constrict tiering thresholds based upon performance experience. Timely modifications to facility tiering criteria can improve the quality and accuracy of facility groupings that can significantly influence the responding chemical facilities planning and resulting compliance costs. Planning and the resulting compliance costs associated with the 1-4 level stratification have a derivative exponential cost increase impact. Improved accuracy in the initial tiering declaration of facilities will result in: (1) relevant containment of affected chemical facility expenditures, (2) higher confidence of affected facilities in the program, and (3) more productive use of program Inspection resources.","Delivered IOC of CHEMSEC.Migrated all data, including facility case files, from CHEMS to CHEMSEC.Delivered subsequent incremental releases of CHEMSEC.Began development of user-requested enhancements to CSAT via the CFATS Improvement Project.Developed additional entity functionality for Personnel Surety, in order to maintain the application's conformance to current rulemaking.","CSATs is in a maintenance/sustainment phase, effective as of the end of FY13. During FY15, ISCD plans to perform maintenance on CSATs, comprising minor enhancements, bug fixes, and patches that may be required to adapt to changes in business rules or business process improvements. Anticipated enhancements for FY15 include:*         CSAT Improvement Project - changes to the Top Screen, SVA, and SSP survey tools to remove redundant questions and improve data quality in survey responses; changes to the tiering engines in response to the external Peer Review panel's recommendations.*         Executive Order 13650 - Adding links to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Substance Registry System (SRS); jointly developing (with other Federal agencies) schemas for facilities and chemicals.*         Personnel Surety - Converting the data exchange with TSA from FTP to a web service.Future DME for the investment consists of development of new functionality to support the AN program. This activity will begin in FY16, with IOC deployment scheduled for FY17. The first phase comprises the capability to register users who wish to purchase AN.

Performance Based Contracts are only required under FAR 37.102 and are not applicable to interagency agreements.  However, DOE will perform its responsibilities under the IAA in part through service contracts.  These service contracts will be Performance Based and activity administered to ensure that the performance standards are met or exceeded.  Project milestones are planned with supporting defined activities reflecting planned costs and planned durations for all investment vendors. The monthly reported costs for each milestone is tracked and compared to the respective plan. Deliverables and burn rates are monitored and maintained responding to leadership project priorities. The inherent nature of a regulatory program that is still under development is that:  requirements, priorities and timelines are dynamic in responding to: legislative changes, new emerging requirements, delays in legislation, leadership personnel changes and fluctuations in appropriated funding. This needed flexibility in resource contracting types is key to the program's success.","3","The National Program and Protection Directorate (NPPD) - Infrastructure Security Compliance Project - Chemical Security Assessment Tool (ISCP-CSAT) Suite is in the Mixed life-cycle phase.

IDENT compares fingerprints against stored records used to determine a subject's identity. These fingerprints and biometrics provide unique, reliable, and forgery resistant capabilities for identity verification. By matching, storing, sharing, and analyzing biometric data, IDENT fulfills the goal of providing biometric identity capabilities that support DHS mission needs along with securing the front lines of homeland security with rapid, accurate, and secure identification. IDENT contributes to DHS goals by serving as the designated enterprise provider of biometric identity services. Success to meet the mission is defined by IDENT's ability to meet Service Level Agreements with its customers and stakeholders. OBIM, through IDENT, demonstrates significant benefits that protect national security and public safety each day. As of March 31, 2014, IDENT stores more than 166M unique biometric identities for legitimate travelers to the US, immigration benefit seekers, visa applicants, individuals seeking credentialing benefits, known or suspected terrorists, criminals, known immigration violators, sexual offenders, domestic and international fugitives; threats to officer safety, enemy combatants, and subjects inadmissible to the US. Currently, outside of DHS, no known alternatives exist for OBIM customers and stakeholders that can provide the same biometric identity services. Without IDENT, end users would be deprived of biometric identity verification and watchlist matching for determining admissibility or eligibility for immigration benefits. IDENT stakeholders internal to DHS include CBP, ICE, USCIS, TSA, USCG, FEMA, and OCSO. External stakeholders include DoD, DOS, DOJ, FBI/CJIS, Interpol, OPM, the intelligence and the international community, State and local law enforcement agencies, and several foreign governments. These stakeholders utilize the biometric identity verification and watchlist matching services that IDENT provides in support of the DHS missions Preventing Terrorism & Enhancing Security; Securing & Managing our Borders; Enforcing & Administering our Immigration Laws.","024-015 : US-VISIT","IDENT is aligned under the Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture (HLSEA) Person Screening Segment within the Screening Functional Area. This segment describes screening as: (1) a set of functions for performing physical and information-based screening of cargo and people and their belongings (baggage, conveyance) in order to identify cargo and individuals who may pose a threat and/or are ineligible for access; (2) detecting objects which may pose a threat; (3) granting or verifying a license, privilege, or status (physical or virtual); and (4) ensuring individual privacy and redress opportunities. People Screening focuses on the electronic screening of people and the granting, use, and revocation of any associated benefits or credentials. IDENT has been designated by DHS as the enterprise provider of biometric services for DHS both in terms of current (as-is) and target architecture. IDENT has evolved and continues to evolve in alignment with HLSEA guidance in terms of expanding the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and of National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) compliant data exchanges. IDENT alignment to the HLSEA is captured in the DHS Enterprise Architecture Information Repository (EAIR). Biometric match-store-share-analyze services can continue to be provided to existing customers. In addition, technical innovation can be achieved through the implementation of a replacement biometric system that can provide current services to an expanded user base, as well as additional biometric services to all users. For example, current plans for a replacement biometric system will accommodate entire gallery searches within 10 seconds for CBP primary queries, a capability which CBP needs. Further, it will provide multimodal capability to meet CBP and Border Patrol needs for use of iris, and USCG requirements for iris and facial biometric modalities. In addition, the replacement biometric system will allow DHS to fully support the additional biometric transaction and enrollment volumes associated with Comprehensive Immigration Reform.","DHS invested in OBIM as its lead for biometric identity services through IDENT, which is a legacy system in operational steady state; therefore, it does not have an identified return on investment. IDENT supports DHS QHSR findings and strategy for an integrated Homeland Security Enterprise for DHS and its components, other Federal departments, State, local, and tribal law enforcement, the intelligence community, and foreign partners. It is an integrated component of a networked Homeland Security Enterprise that addresses multi-threat, all-hazard security considerations. IDENT data and analysis helps secure and protect the U.S. against terrorism, enables data integration and analysis, supports and strengthens responsive immigration processing systems and law enforcement, minimizes disruptions to the trade and travel system, and supports a smarter, stronger border by enhancing our security infrastructure through support to new technologies. IDENT aligns with preventing terrorism and enhancing security, securing and managing our borders, and enforcing and administering our immigration laws as stated in the DHS IPG for FYs 2016-2020. IDENT's crosscutting mission alignments with the current and pending DHS Strategic Plans enables Department unity of effort. IDENT provides timely, actionable information to decision makers for public safety, border security, immigration and citizenship laws and services, common vetting and benefits validation. It delivers verified biometric identity data by matching, storing, sharing, and analyzing biometric data.

Success of the IDENT system primarily is measured by the ability of the system to meet performance metrics and SLAs with customers and stakeholders for accuracy, reliability, and system availability. OBIM focuses on achieving efficiencies by reducing 2-print processing through transitioning the 2-print fingerprint galleries to the 10-print fingerprint galleries in the IDENT matcher systems. This transition will enable a reduction in rack fees at both DHS Data Centers. It will realize efficiencies as the storage of 2-print and 10-print systems is duplicative, unnecessary, and costly to maintain. OBIM supports the expansion of data sharing with additional agencies such as DoD. OBIM will onboard new customers such as TSA and FEMA.","FY 2015:1) Maintain IDENT Service Levels by focusing resources on critical break/fix issues, technical refreshes, and maintenance. 2)Platform Integration (P795 Consolidation / Upgrade): Utilize existing IBM P795 platform to enable 84 additional processing cores and 1.6 TB of memory split between two data centers. This will cause a reduction in O&M cost by reducing the system footprint, shortening outage times, & reducing the number of infrastructure components. 3) Next Generation Storage Solutions: The current storage system is obsolete & will be replaced with a new storage system to provide the scalability to continue to expand the size of the IDENT database to accommodate growth. 4) 10-Print Matchers Procurement and Installation: When daily transactions exceed the capacity of IDENT's matcher sub-system, the system can no longer process transactions within the SLA timeframes that IDENT users require, raising the potential for operational impacts on end users. This will accommodate growth & ensure transactions continue to be processed. 5) Image Separation: Separates IDENT images from the transactional database, reducing the size, complexity, & management burdens of the IDENT database. This results in a reduced system footprint. The stakeholder benefit is improved database responsiveness & system availability. 6) Messaging Infrastructure Consolidation: Currently, the IDENT system includes two messaging infrastructures: the LSB & ESB. This duplicate infrastructure is unnecessary & increases IDENT complexity & O&M costs. This effort will consolidate all messaging occurring at the LSB into the ESB; eliminating the LSB. 7) Transaction Manager Queue Optimization: IDENT relies on a loosely-coupled message-queuing architecture to move messages and data between applications &  functional system components. This will introduce a higher level of optimization by allowing IDENT to manage transaction loads in a deterministic yet dynamic. 8) Operational Data Storage (ODS): Automated access to mission critical data extracted from external storage to meet customer requirements for data queries & reports to allow for more fraud detection, image quality, and trend analysis. 9) Enterprise Record Retention Schedule: This functionality will delete biometric records that have reached retention disposition in accordance with the stakeholder's requirements.

ADIS collects and maintains arrival/departure information on non-US citizens traveling to the US, and matches this information to a person, thereby creating a complete record of events compliant with visa admissibility and issuance provisions. The benefits to the government and stakeholders include assistance with determining admissibility, law enforcement action, Visa approval/denial and Visa Waiver Program eligibility. ADIS benefits users by matching travel events with changes in immigration status to provide an overstay status. Benefits also include support for anticipated immigration reform and expansion of biographic and biometric exit activities. ADIS looks at arrival and departure data collectively from multiple sources to determine whether a person departed the US on time or if they legally extended their immigration status. Overstays are divided into 2 categories: (1) in-country overstays (ICO), meaning an individual overstayed and is still thought to be in the US, and; (2) out-of-country overstays (OCO), meaning an individual left the country, but overstayed the period of admission before departing. Internal stakeholders to DHS are OBIM, ICE, USCIS, TSA, and the USCG. External stakeholders include DOS, NTC and the intelligence community. Key customers include CBP, ICE, USCIS and the State Department. ADIS incorporates data elements and transactions associated with CBP systems and other immigration systems to create and maintain complete histories for roughly 295M travelers as of 7/1/14 and uses 17 servers at 2 DHS data centers and processes more than 2.5M transactions a day. ADIS O&M costs include support for infrastructure management, application management, network support and data center support. ADIS services are growing in usage, include a 24/7 help desk, and maintain system uptime at 99% or greater. ADIS enables DHS to comply with Congressional, legislative, operational, and executive mandates by helping to determine if foreign nationals have overstayed terms of admission and enhances homeland security by providing a cost-effective response to the entry-exit statutory mandate to determine whether foreign nationals are legally in the US. ADIS operations contribute to mission delivery of the Department by directly supporting the DHS missions of Securing the Borders and Administering and Enforcing Immigration Laws.","024-042 : Securing America's Borders","ADIS is an advanced platform used to identify potential instances of overstay. ADIS is aligned under the Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture (HLS EA) Person Screening Segment within the Screening Functional Area. This investment supports the QHSR Mission 2: Secure and Manage Our Borders. This segment describes screening as: (1) a set of functions for performing physical and information-based screening of cargo and people and their belongings (baggage, conveyance) in order to identify cargo and individuals who may pose a threat and/or are ineligible for access; (2) detecting objects which may pose a threat; (3) granting or verifying a license, privilege, or status (physical or virtual); and (4) ensuring individual privacy and redress opportunities. People Screening focuses on the electronic screening of people and the granting, use and revocation of any associated benefits or credentials. ADIS is progressively and innovatively implementing Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture (HLS EA) guidance in moving toward a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). ADIS is now National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) conformant. Additionally, ADIS has leveraged expertise from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to evaluate and improve biographic matching algorithms in efforts towards realizing cost efficiency and innovation.","ADIS is an inherited system in operational steady state, and as such does not have an identified return on investment.Nevertheless, ADIS does produce significant benefits to society that include enhanced border security and enforcement of U.S. immigration laws through the implementation of the following DHS missions, goals, and objectives:-       DHS Mission 2 - Securing and Managing Our Borderso   Goal 2.1 - Effective Control of U.S. Air, Land, Sea Borders and Approaches  Objective 2.1.1 - Prevent Illegal Import and Entry  Objective 2.1.2 - Prevent Illegal Export and Exito   Goal 2.2 - Safeguard Lawful Trade and Travel  Objective 2.2.3 - Manage the Risk of People and Goods in Transit-       Mission 3 - Enforcing and Administering our Immigration Lawso   Goal 3.2 - Prevent Unlawful Immigration  Objective 3.2.3 - Prevent Unlawful Entry or AdmissionADIS supports these missions, goals, and objectives by serving as the Department's primary provider of overstay status and biographic identity services. Success to meet the mission is defined by ADIS's ability to meet performance parameters designed to monitor progress towards providing the business needs of customers and stakeholders. Continued investment in ADIS is beneficial as ADIS represents a comprehensive, integrated system to track entry to and exit from the US. Determining if foreign nationals have overstayed their terms of admission enhances homeland security; ADIS provides a cost-effective response to the entry-exit statutory mandate to determine whether foreign nationals are legally in the US. ADIS is presently the only system in the Federal government that collects and retains overstay data, and is a critical part of evaluating whether VWP countries remain eligible for visa waiver status as granted by DHS. These services represent an invaluable contribution to our nation's security.","Performed an Operational Analysis and maintained operations within acceptable OMB cost ranges.  Transferred operational & IT management aspects from OBIM to CBP per 2014 congressional appropriations mandating the system transfer. Conducted stakeholder briefings with system users and developed a roadmap for future operations. Performed a major O&M release consisting of upgrades and changes targeting fixes to process South West Border biographic departure updates; updating business rules between ADIS and TECS I94 system data exchange to resolve closing out I94 records with departure request transactions; providing the capability to search ADIS Web by the IDENT EID field, and deployed break fixes to existing ADIS services with ICE, TSA, USCIS and State Dept.

OneNet supports the Secretary of Homeland Security's goal to Strengthen and Unify DHS Operations and Management, supporting all of the Department's strategic goals and business objectives: awareness, prevention, protection, response, recovery, service, and organizational excellence. DHS OneNet investments provide a critical infrastructure foundation which supports systems that disseminate information across all DHS Components (including external customers and intelligence partners). The DHS CIO's vision to fortify this foundation is embodied in OneNet. It is through the execution of OneNet initiatives that barriers to collaboration and information sharing within and across DHS Components are reduced and operational efficiencies are achieved. OneNet represents a transition to enterprise services through developing, implementing, and managing cross-organizational efforts.  OneNet initiatives have addressed vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, cyber security, and disaster recovery gaps noted in FY05-07 GAO and DHS Inspector General Reports. The uniform network services, consolidated computing asset footprint, standardized email platform and wireless strategic initiatives provided by OneNet will also continue to provide more efficient system maintenance, management, and administration costs. Key customers of OneNet include State, Local, and Tribal Governments; Customs and Border Protection, Intelligence & Analysis, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as other federal civilian agencies. The stakeholders of OneNet include DHS, its components, State, Local, and Tribal Governments, as well as the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO)/Information Technology Service Office (ITSO), Federal Protective Service, and other various government, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies that communicate classified data.","000-000 : (Primary Program Not Available)","The  One Net Program contributes to the target EA by creating 7 Enterprise level Shared Services, which are listed in the DHS Enterprise Roadmap (ver 6.0, May 2013). These Enterprise Shared Services are as follows: 1) Network, , 2) High Assurance Gateway (HAG), 3) Policy Enforcement Points (PEP), 4) Reverse Proxy, 5) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC), 6) Data Center Consolidation, and 7) Email as a Service (EaaS). The creation of these Enterprise Shared Services is one of the strategic steps for transitioning to the Target EA.  In addition, these Enterprise Shared Services align to the current Information Technology Infrastructure (ITI) Segment Architecture.","The direct cost benefits are realized by reducing the DHS footprint by consolidating seven wide area networks WANs, and reducing 16 Component-level data centers to two DHS hosted datacenters. By doing so, DHS created one network (OneNet). OneNet is able to enforce and increase information sharing across all component agencies, implement enterprise level cyber security requirements, implement Policy Enforcement Points (PEP), and maintain a centralized architecture. OneNet enables information sharing requirements, across all Component agencies, by removing lag time and complexity in accessing data. OneNet is a secure, robust and flexible enterprise platform which facilitates deployment of Department wide capabilities and providing a cost-effective and reliable infrastructure. Savings are achieved through centralized operational control, and standardized IT acquisitions. This, by default, streamlines maintenance and support contracts, which helps DHS achieves cost savings. Governmental Cyber security enhancements are consolidated and easily implemented across the enterprise. OneNet also allows information sharing with DHS external stakeholders; federal state, local and  tribal law enforcement agencies, fulfilling the Securing the Homeland mission.  The Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) is an OMB security mandate that was implemented at both data centers. The TIC implements a comprehensive suite of security capabilities to include: firewalls and proxy services for enforcing the Department's internet usage policies, and monitoring tools designed to alert on a wide range of threats. The PEP is managed at the OneNet EOC and establishes trusted zones which facilitate information sharing across components. Implementing these security enhancements at the enterprise level reduces cost, complexity, risk and improves incident monitoring, reporting and response times.","FY 2014 Planned Accomplishments             Implement QoS recommendations.             Award TIC services contract (MTIPS).             Continue to purchase and install equipment to improve network security and performance.

DCD supports the consolidation of legacy data center environments to two enterprise-wide DHS Data Centers by funding essential infrastructure, capability enhancements, disaster recovery and support services to meet current and anticipated data service requirements. This includes essential power upgrades and other investments required to enable DC1 and DC2 to reach full capacity and meet service level objectives.","This investment is predominantly in the O&M phase and are thus not required to use EVM.  DHS does not intend to use EVM on Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Time and Materials (T&M), and service contracts because it may not be a cost-effective way to measure the performance of the contractor. Of the contracts outlined above, 5 are FFP, T&M, service contracts, and/or contracts that solely support O&M functions not requiring EVM. There are an additional 19 contracts involving interagency agreements or small awards (<$5M) for which EVM is also not intended. Notably in the table, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), Creative Computing Solutions, Inc (CCSi), and Electronic Data Systems LLC (EDS), contracts would normally require EVM due their total contract values respectively. The application of EVM on T&M efforts however is optional (at the discretion of the program manager) under DHS guidelines. EVM, in this instance, is only applied to Logical Follow-On (LFO) task orders associated with these contracts. ESD primarily uses Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with financial incentives and disincentives based on agreed-upon performance standards.  These standards have been defined at various levels to manage contractor performance; and cascaded from enterprise level requirements to each Component's mission-centric subscribed service needs. Contract layering from this perspective has yielded compliance with enterprise level targets, better information sharing across Components, and efficient deployment of critical technical support when needed. Contracts under this Investment are also subject to a rigorous Quality Assurance Surveillance process and routine Contract Technical Review as supplementary mechanisms to mitigate the Government's risk while employing T&M contract vehicles. Negative results from these reviews are not only documented and further addressed in accordance with the Risk and Issues Management approach outlined in the Appendix of this Exhibit, but may also expose the contractor to financial penalty outlined in the SLAs.The ITP's acquisition approach has been successful thus far in aggregating a picture of performance necessary to ensure consistency with the Program's objectives. As existing contracts mature, leadership will continue to seek the flexibility in ITP procurement vehicles, consolidated service delivery, and streamlined business processes necessary to maintain an environment of continual improvement in the acquisitions arena.","3","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) OneNet Program is in the Support life cycle phase.

WebIFMIS receives data from other financial and mixed systems and from direct user input and it provides data and supports processing for those systems that need it, including DHS and government-wide reporting systems.  The goal of WebIFMIS is striving to maintain current efficiencies of operations by maintaining cost accountability, controlling the expenditure of funds, and supporting the everyday and disaster operations with financial services that meet accounting standards.  Automation and interfaces with disaster mission support systems expedite payments to disaster victims, and provide auditable data for financial and mission accomplishment reporting.    The benefits include past improvements in the accounts receivable functionality, automate and facilitate the collection of overpayments, thus reducing the cost of disaster support.  In addition, the automation of the processes through interfaces reduces the staff time required to collect overpayments, thereby reducing resources required for processing.  WebIFMIS is vital to the agency conducting its mission.  The key customers and stakeholders include all FEMA component organizations, as every component relies on WebIFMIS for financial management and stewardship.  Key stakeholders include U.S. Congress, Office of Management and Budget, Department of Homeland Security, FEMA Programs and Offices, Regional Directors, Budget Officers, Financial Managers, Department of Justice, Grantees/Grantors, JP Morgan Chase, Health and Human Services, National Flood Insurance Program (G/L WYO Insurance Companies), Internal Revenue Service, Government Online Accounting and the general public experiencing a major disaster.  If this investment is not fully funded, it will have a significant impact to the American citizens, as it will be a challenge for FEMA to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards.  This would be unfortunate for FEMA, DHS and our nation, as a whole.","024-008 : Response","FEMA Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a management practice for aligning resources to improve business performance and help the agency better execute their core missions.  An EA describes the current and future state of the agency, and lays out a plan for transitioning from the current state to the desired future state.  WebIFMIS adheres to the hardware and software standards laid out by DHS and FEMA EA.  WebIFMIS currently aligns to the current EA architecture by providing critical financial management planning, decisions and execution for the Agency.","WebIFMIS is in the Operations and Maintenance phase of the project with an expected retirement in 2016.  A return on investment (ROI) has not been conducted since April 27, 2007.  However, as FEMA's core financial management system, WebIFMIS continues to provide benefits to FEMA, DHS, and the public.  WebIFMIS continues to provide the financial management and stewardship for the Agency.","It was recognized at the start of FY 2012 that IFMIS was at a critical juncture and nearing collapse.  IFMIS was operating at or near 100% capacity on a near-continuous basis.  IFMIS was operating on 20-year-old technology using a COBOL program modified to support an Oracle database. The hardware was no longer supported by its manufacturer and reached its end of useful life.   In FY13, to sustain the life and viability of the core financial management system, FEMA began the technology efforts to migrate to a RedHat Enterprise Linux operating system on a virtualized environment and upgrade from Oracle 9i to 11g database, now referred to as WebIFMIS.  The upgrade would allow FEMA to port the system onto newer, more contemporary hardware, which enhances sustainability and scalability of the system.  In addition, the upgrade would extend the useful life of the system until FEMA migrates to a modernized core financial management system.","In the CY, on May 15, 2013, IFMIS migrated to a RedHat Enterprise Linux operating system and upgraded the database from Oracle 9i to 11g, now referred to as WebIFMIS.  Upon completion, this allowed the financial system to be hosted using hardware that can be supported.   The IFMIS Technology Refresh Project included development and testing of the reprogrammed IFMIS in the developer's location, deployment and testing in FEMA's environment, and testing and deployment at a disaster recovery site.  Benefits includes:  Allows the system to operate in the FEMA/DHS environment, eliminates maintenance/upgrades of the HP-UX servers, staffing hours to support the HP-UX servers, and FEMA's dependence on the proprietary operating system, and provides direct access to WebIFMIS by FEMA field personnel from any disaster location.  In addition, WebIFMIS is in the process of deploying several maintenance releases.  WebIFMIS Release 10.02 was deployed April 6, 2013 to interface WebIFMIS to the Non-Disaster Grants system.  WebIFMIS Release 11.0 is scheduled to deploy August 24, 2013 to Performance Partnership Agreement (PPA) and Third Party (TP) Main Account.

The goal of the program is to: provide disaster survivors a portal to all available forms of assistance, to provide federal agencies an effective automated data interchange, to reduce costs, and reduce fraud waste and abuse. The benefits of investment in DAIP ease the burden on disaster survivors, improve service delivery and reduce duplicative costs by multiple agencies.  DAIP provides a central portal reducing the cost and technical barriers to participation for federal agencies; increasing the number and types of assistance available, streamlining delivery of services and improving internal controls. DAIP is enhancing government's mobile and SMS text message capabilities so disaster survivors can access disaster assistance information in a way most likely to be available to them immediately following a disaster when phone and power lines may be damaged. At the same time, this effort greatly reduces the cost burden to the government and increases services to capabilities to the survivors.Contribution to Mission Delivery:DAIP directly supports FEMA's core mission ...ensure that as a nation we ...build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards. DAIP supports DHS FEMA's efforts to comply with the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006.Key Customers, Stakeholders, and Other Beneficiaries:Beneficiaries of the DAIP and DisasterAssistance.gov are the survivors of disasters (American tax payers, the general public and small businesses). Stakeholders of DAIP include 16 Federal Agencies such as FEMA, DHS, SBA, HUD and SSA.  The beneficiaries and primary users of DAIP (DisasterAssistance.gov) are survivors of federally declared disasters, the American tax payer, the general public, small businesses, local communities, and the 16 federal agency stakeholders that sponsor the program. Collaboration with other agencies through DAIP ensures a coordinated Federal approach to the delivery of disaster assistance. DAIP collaborates with nonprofit organizations and tribal, state and local governments to provide DisasterAssistance.gov information to identify additional resources to include on the portal that would be beneficial to disaster survivors.","024-009 : Recovery","DAIP supports the DHS IRM Strategic Plan by utilizing tools and methods enumerated in the DHS Target EA. These items include Cloud Computing, Data Sharing, Security, Collaboration and Effectiveness. As such, DAIP has migrated front end hosting to DHS cloud services, and utilizes DHS Web Content Management as a Service (WCMaaS), DHS Enterprise Data Centers, FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) Disaster Assistance Center module, the DHS Enterprise Oracle SOA platform and the DHS/FEMA ISAAC systems to host the disaster assistance application. DAIP supports the DHS EA Roadmap.  The DAIP program is located in the Incident Management Segment Portfolio under the:DHS MISSION Area 5: ENSURING RESILIENCE TO DISASTER, 5.4: Rapidly Recover, 5.4.1: Enhance recovery capabilities;DAIP directly supports recovery services through Public Assistance delivered to communities gauging the quality of program services, supporting infrastructure, and customer satisfaction following a disaster.As well as the recovery services through Individual Assistance delivered to disaster survivors gauging the quality of program services, supporting infrastructure, and customer satisfaction following a disaster. For technical innovation, DAIP implemented FEMA's first Oracle Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) platform to securely facilitate the exchange of disaster survivor PII with other disaster assistance programs and supported the SOA's subsequent transition to a FEMA general support system (GSS), allowing other IT investments to perform similar functions.  Innovation continues in efforts to make the DAIP system mobile compatible and accessible, the use of Akamai Global Traffic Management to throttle site visitors and future implementations of a forms engine that will allow other disaster assistance programs to host their application forms on the DAIP system, further reducing the need for survivors to enter duplicated data across multiple forms of assistance.    DAIP achieves programmatic innovation through its collaborative governance structure among the Program's Federal partner agencies, portfolio and project management tools and integration with FEMA Individual Assistance and National Processing Service Center Operations Branch to ensure that applicant processes within FEMA and the larger Federal government are considered in the overall technical solution.","DAIP has established six measures of program value; Ensure expedited identification of programs for which disaster survivors may be eligible, make them accessible by easing the effort of applying for the benefits, and to receive those benefits as quickly as possible, conduct outreach and provide the opportunity for all disaster survivors eligible to apply for benefits,  provide timely and accurate information to the disaster survivor to support the disaster application benefit award and inform the survivor the status of submitted applications, apply cost avoidance to reduce program delivery costs, detect, capture and resolve failed attempts by disaster survivors to access benefit processes, or applications for benefits actions that have been delayed due to systems misadventure, minimize improper payments by establishing and maintaining controls to achieve the reduction of improper payments, fraud, waste or abuse.  For the period of actual and simulated activity, the sum of planning costs is $34.89M, DME, excluding planning costs, are $49.16M. DME Government FTEs are $15.43, for a total of $99.48M. O&M costs are $219.92M, for a total cost of $305.67M for the period. The values of two of the six benefit classifications, Notification and Inquiry and Cost Offset, have been evaluated. Notification and Inquiry contributes $290.60M and the Cost Offset due to automated registration and application is $37.69M, for a total benefit of $328.29M. The net benefit of $108.37M and investment of $99.475M yields a simple ROI of 8.94%, that is, each dollar invested returns that dollar plus an additional $.09, benefits split between the taxpayer in reduced costs and additional services provided to the disaster survivor.","FY14 Accomplishments Implemented mobile compatibility for prescreening questionnaires and application status inquiries Redesigned DisasterAssistance.gov and implement usability enhancements aimed at improving the overall user experience and ease-of-use Implemented enhancements to the application process that support Federal disaster declarations in Tribal nations Implemented Google Analytics to support robust site usage metrics collection Implemented FedAPP a COTS forms engine to support the hosting and delivery of partner disaster applications and reduce costs Worked with the DAIP Working Group and Executive Steering Committee to achieve ratification of the DAIP Strategic Plan, Scope Document and developed a new integrated multiyear partner funding model Achieved green rating in most recent DHS Office of Accessible Systems and Technology and the annual DHS OCIO program health assessments Implemented BAM monitoring and reporting tool for DAIP SOA platform.","Budget Year (FY15) and beyond planned objectives:  Investigate and implement Global Spatial Mapping (such as Google maps) technology to provide local resource searches on DisasterAssistance.gov.   Implement social media integration by incorporating Facebook Like and Follow buttons on DisasterAssistance.gov pages and individual forms of assistance.  Implement SMS, or text message capability that pushes notifications to subscribed disaster survivor mobile devices when their application status changes. Expand Forms Engine to facilitate e-gov partner agencies to host forms [types] of assistances applications centrally in DisasterAssistance.gov.  This system enhancement will reduce costs of partner integration.

The program compensated by cutting O&M costs significantly by utilizing the DHS Cloud infrastructure, implementing Open Source Content Management and reducing ongoing contractor costs.  Planned spending on O&M has dropped 20% from FY12.  Savings on O&M will carry forward through FY15.","All DAIP contracts that are development or planning related are required to meet mandated EVM reporting requirements. DAIP O&M contracts are not required to report EVM.  All DME contractors are required to report ANSI complaint EVM on a monthly basis. DHS and ANSI standards are used to ensure EV tracking, reporting and analysis.  The EV analysis is performed to assist in managing the project and its resources to a successful outcome. The DAIP Program Management Office (PMO) collects and consolidates cost, schedule, and performance metrics utilizing an Integrated Master Schedule that tracks EVM for contractor costs and tasks. Contractors report actual monthly cost and schedule data to ensure planned milestones are met on schedule and at planned cost. The DAIP PMO submits a monthly EVM report to FEMA, DHS, and all of its stakeholders and if cost or schedule variances exceed 10%, the DAIP PMO works with the appropriate personnel to develop a corrective action plan. The Program Manager also meets with the PMO contractor on a bi-weekly basis to review costs to date, cost projections, staffing changes and issues related to cost and schedule. All actions from the meeting are recorded and their status reviewed each week for progress. In addition, future contracts, including the current acquisition for follow-on Enhancement Support, will require EVM and will be performance-based. T&M contracts will also require EVM, and will include specific, performance-based milestones that must be met throughout the life of each contract.","4","The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) is in the Mixed life cycle phase. The Program has operated within acceptable OMB ranges for cost and schedule variance since the last assessment. Program tasks are being completed for Sustainment & Releases, Content Management, Hosting and collecting User Experience metrics. DAIP reported corrective action for two areas of project initiation. Project business processes were modified so that only PM-approved performance baselines are implemented. DAIP is looking to increase the level of program participation from Federal partner agencies. This is tied to DAIP partial dependence on funding from non-DHS resources. Program coordination with other Federal Agencies will continue to require close coordination. DAIP continues to support DHS strategic goals and help disaster survivors.

The IPAWS Program develops, implements, and maintains this national public alert and warning system available  for alerting authorities at all levels of government to use to send emergency alerts to their local population. IPAWS supports QHSR Mission 5: Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience, DHS Goal 5.3: Ensure Effective Emergency Response, Objective 5.3.1: Provide timely and accurate information to the public, and established the following IPAWS Program Goals to support mission delivery: 1) Create, maintain, and evolve an integrated interoperable environment for alert and warning; 2) Make alert and warning more effective; 3) Strengthen the resilience of IPAWS infrastructure; 4) Enhance the means for monitoring and measuring success; and 5) Develop an IPAWS PMO workforce that is will trained and satisfied.  The key benefits of IPAWS are that it expanded and continues to modernize the Primary Entry Points (PEP) systems of radio stations in order to cover 90% of the population and provides IPAWS-OPEN to provide alternated pathways to communicate alerts and warning to the American people. IPAWS covers existing gaps in emergency communication by modernizing the National Emergency Alert System (EAS) to include expanding and modernizing the PEP system in order to cover 90% of the population and providing integrated access to additional emergency alerting pathways such as wireless phones, NOAA Weather Radios, and Internet applications through the IPAWS-OPEN systems. As a result, IPAWS mitigates the impact of disasters by providing effective communications paths for delivering life-saving alert and emergency information to American citizens. The primary beneficiary for IPAWS is the American public.  Other stakeholders include Federal, State, territorial, tribal, and local alerting authorities for whom the system is provided free and allows to communicate alerts and warnings at their level through more communications pathways than before.  In addition to local government alerting authorities, NOAA,  DHS, and the DoJ are key stakeholders at the Federal level because IPAWS provides them the vastly expanded capability to provide weather and AMBER Alerts via alternative communications pathways.","024-006 : Preparedness","IPAWS aligns with the Incident Management DHS Functional Portfolio and is consistent with the DHS Technical Reference Model and FEMA Enterprise Architecture reference models.  The IPAWS architecture and systems leverage the FEMA Information Services Architecture (FISA) Service Oriented Architecture approach.  IPAWS employed an already developed FEMA DM-OPEN application for alert and warning web services, and a SOA Oracle infrastructure developed by the FEMA Disaster Assistance Improvement Project.  IPAWS supports NIEM Information Exchange Package Document (IEPDs) - NIEM IEPDs are encapsulated as Content Objects in Emergency Data Exchange Language- Distribution Element (EDXL-DE) in OPEN to enable their routing.  IPAWS adopted the industry developed Common Alerting Protocol for exchange of incident warning information.  The use of the industry standard enables IPAWS to leverage the innovative power of the private sector in developing applications for use and interface with IPAWS.  The reuse and sharing of the FEMA SOA platform supports the FEMA EA Roadmap for consolidation of applications to a common enterprise service bus architecture.","IPAWS provides integrated public alert and warning capabilities to State and local public safety officials, the National Weather Service, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (AMBER Alerts). Public safety officials can use IPAWS to send Wireless Emergency Alerts directly to all cellular phones in an affected area.  Over 3000 emergency weather alerts, 40 AMBER Alerts, and 5 local emergency alerts from State or Local officials have been sent through IPAWS to date. The IPAWS Program infrastructure and the agreements and partnership with private sector communications companies may be leveraged by more than 20,000, non-federal public safety officials to send local alerts and warnings to citizens in their jurisdiction. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children cancelled a cellular alerting contract valued at approximately $1M/year when the AMBER Alerts capability via IPAWS was initiated in December 2012. Estimated cost for the National Weather Service to implement a national cellular alerting capability independent of IPAWS is estimated at $2M/year. Based on the life cycle cost of the IPAWS Program, the investment per US citizen is less than $1.00 for a capability that can be used by public safety officials at the local, state, and federal level to send alert and warning information through multiple private sector communications systems to citizens within their jurisdiction.","FY 2013 Major Accomplishments Added 31 State, 2 territorial, and 121 local authority organizations as IPAWS alerting authorities.196 additional applications are in process and IPAWS receives on average 54 new applications per week as a result of outreach and training efforts. Deployed IPAWS-OPEN public alerts feed enabling Internet applications and web sites to monitor and distribute public alerts. Released public service announcements to TV, Radio and the internet to inform citizens about the new Wireless Emergency Alerts on cellular phones and a short IPAWS training course for the public through FEMA's Emergency Management Institute. Completed addition of remaining planned PEP stations to provide direct broadcast coverage to over 90% of the US population and retrofitted three legacy PEP stations.","FY 2014 Planned Accomplishments:-Expand the number of state and local alerting authorities using IPAWS-OPEN through training and outreach.-Sustain IPAWS-OPEN operations and maintenance providing mission critical cellular, radio and TV, National Weather Radio, and Internet alert and warning capabilities to Federal, State and local public safety officials.-Maintain the National EAS and Primary Entry Point network providing mission critical alert and warning capability to the President.-Continue to coordinate Access and Functional Needs and multiple language alert and warning requirements and solutions with community representatives, industry, and regulatory officials, and citizens.FY 2015 Planned Accomplishments:-Expand the number of state and local alerting authorities using IPAWS-OPEN through training and outreach and provide public education on how to access, use, and respond to emergency alerts. -Sustain IPAWS-OPEN operations and maintenance providing mission critical cellular, radio and TV, National Weather Radio, and Internet alert and warning capabilities to Federal, State and local public safety officials.  -Retrofit three legacy Primary Entry Point stations with new fuel storage, power generation, back up transmitters and electromagnetic pulse protections and maintain the National EAS, Primary Entry Point stations and network providing mission critical alert and warning capability for the President.-Continue to coordinate Access and Functional Needs and multiple language alert and warning requirements and solutions with community representatives, industry, and regulatory officials, and citizens.","no","no","no","yes","no","yes","yes","no","","no","210.013000","10.864000","10.852000","15.120000","2007","2024","Reduced funding include: a reduction from $25.0M to $10.8M per year for FY14 and future years; additional $3M cut to both FY13 and FY14 will delay several critical milestones to FY17.

LSCMS provides FEMA with the flexibility to respond to and recover from all hazards as well as provide full disaster supply chain visibility to FEMA and its partners.  Specifically, the goals of LSCMS include the ability to: - Manage the entire supply chain, including FEMA-owned assets and resources as well as those provided by partners in other federal agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) - Ensure the right resources/commodities are available at the right place and time  - Divert resources/commodities based on changing demand - Know the location and status of capital assets, commodities, and all other resources in real time - See inventory at all distribution nodes (e.g. Distribution Centers (DCs), Incident Support Bases (ISBs), Mobile Housing Unit (MHU) sites, and material delivered to state staging areas and local Points of Distribution (PODs) - Integrate with the supply chains of partners in federal government agencies, and other Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) and non-ESF federal agencies, NGOs, and logistics service vendors - Share supply chain data with state/local/tribal governments - Provide a resource that all FEMA strategic partners can use to support transparent and fully coordinated end-to-end disaster response - Provide supply chain visibility to all stakeholders - Scale resources to meet requirementsStakeholders of LSCMS include DHS/FEMA senior leadership, FEMA logistics management, FEMA regional management, FEMA IT (e.g., EA and Security), and other FEMA Divisions (e.g., National Preparedness, Disaster Assistance, Disaster Operations), State/local/tribal government, Emergency Support Function agencies, vendors/suppliers/carriers/logistics providers, oversight bodies (including Congress, OMB, GAO, OIG), and media.  Direct customers are FEMA HQ and regions, ESF partners, and state emergency managers and responders.  The ultimate customers are citizens who benefit from the timely delivery of disaster relief assets.Specific benefits include improvements in billing accountability, receiving processes, inventory accountability/accuracy, visibility, trailer load times, reporting, commodity management, and quality assurance.","024-008 : Response","LSCMS is significantly improving the effectiveness, accuracy and efficiency of field logistics operations through wireless tools supporting hand held devices and bar code guns which allow commodities to more quickly pass to disaster survivors and by eliminating manual data entry errors that could affect tracking and stock level accuracy.  It also allows for the faster, safer and more orderly conduct of warehouse and disaster support base operations.","In April 2014 DHS issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum directing FEMA to pause new development of LSCMS to allow time to conduct a critical analysis and determine and approve a path forward. An analysis of gaps to current requirements, a limited analysis of alternatives (AoA) to address the gaps, and an operational benchmarking similar to other logistics operations is to be performed. The LSCMS Program Office worked with DHS to obtain AoA contractor expertise from MITRE - timeframe to complete the AoA Study Plan is 11/20/14 and the Limited AoA by 11/30/15. Annual LSCMS acquisition costs vary, O&M costs change as development components are implemented and public benefits, disaster frequency and severity are unpredictable. The ROI formula has too many unpredictable components to be calculated precisely, but an ROI qualitative analysis is useful:ROI=(((Original Baseline O&M - New Total O&M) + Other Benefits to Society)/Acquisition Cost Only)-1   The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2024 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)   Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in benefits to society.* Previous O&M = averaged $29.85M* New O&M = $24.88MWith increasing resource costs, O&M costs are not anticipated to decrease.* System cost Benefits = $5M* Public Benefits > $20M  ROI = (((29.854M-24.883M)+385.550M)/102.017)-1 = 283%System cost benefits include: Savings from developmental alternatives, resource optimization and hardware and asset inventory; cost avoidances from reduction in legacy O&M costs, better asset management and COOP; and productivity improvements from data visibility, automation, and partner integration.","FY14  A.

These statutes require DHS to prevent individuals from entering a secure area of a vessel or facility unless the individual holds a transportation security card or is accompanied by another individual who holds a card.Contribution to Mission Delivery or Agency Management Support Functions: In accordance with the DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog, Version 1.0, dated January 2013, the TWIC program supports the PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY. Mission and the Screening function as listed in the Capability Portfolio.  As of May 2014, more than 3.0 million workers applied for a TWIC.Goals: The TWIC program provides a vital security measure to ensure that individuals who pose a security threat do not gain unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation industry. Current or Anticipated Benefits: TSA (1) positively verifies each applicant's claimed identity; (2) performs a security threat assessment on each applicant; and (3) produces and issues a TWIC card containing biometric and physical information for each applicant meeting the threat assessment eligibility requirements. The TWIC security threat assessment provides a terrorism/intelligence check, a criminal history records check, and an immigration check. TWICs are tamper-resistant biometric credentials. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential in compliance with regulatory requirements.Key Customers, Stakeholders, and other Beneficiaries: Workers who may be required to obtain a TWIC include facility employees, longshoremen, U.S. mariners, deckhands, long haul and drayage truck drivers, laborers, and other individuals requiring unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels. The TWIC program maintains an extensive outreach effort to an exceptionally diverse group of key stakeholders: Congress; American Association of Port Authorities; National Association of Waterfront Employers; American Trucking Association; American Waterways Operators; Offshore Marine Service Association; Passenger Vessel Association; Intermodal Association of North America; International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union and others.","024-024 : Intermodal Assessments and Enforcement","The TWIC Program began planning in FY11 to move backend infrastructure services from stovepipe to enterprise architecture solutions in support of TSA's Enterprise Architecture guidance. The first step was to move TWIC enrollment services to the Universal Enrollment Services (UES) contract awarded in March 2012. UES supports multiple programs providing enrollment and registration services. With a single contractor providing standardized TSA enrollment services, TSA will achieve economies of scale, consistency across enrollment centers, and faster servicing of new populations as they become regulated. Transition of legacy TWIC enrollment centers was completed on June 28, 2013.  The second and much larger step was to move the TWIC back-end infrastructure to the Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) IDIQ contract. TIM helps TWIC achieve programmatic and technical innovation by consolidating services for multiple programs and using cloud computing and Service-Oriented Architecture. Vetting and credentialing services are available on-demand from the cloud. The TIM system is a scalable and flexible IT platform based on a Federal Enterprise Architecture Service Component-Based Architecture which allows security threat assessments and credentialing to meet the demands of current and future populations. Using these scalable, on-demand services allows TIM to capitalize on economies of scale by integrating a number of aging legacy systems into a state-of-the-art vetting and credentialing system to manage identities, credentials, and assessment results for millions of transportation sector workers. TWIC is the first program to use the TIM system. The TIM program ensures that solutions being created are scalable, reliable, available, reusable and manageable while staying away from technological risks that could jeopardize the growth and/or operations of TSA. This increases business flexibility, cost efficiency, information access, availability, and accuracy by reducing technology complexity.  The TWIC program is using the TIM system for all IT functionality as of July 25, 2014.  The TWIC system is scheduled for disposal in August 2014.","To calculate ROI, the program did a cash flow analysis using the TWIC Funding History report published by the TSA CFO which has the history of funding for the program up to September 30, 2013.  ROI for the TWIC program is calculated as (Cash In - Cash Out)/Cash Out.  Cash In is derived from two sources, appropriated funding provided early in the program and fee revenue collected from transportation workers once the program reached operational capability.  Consequently, as of September 30, 2013, Cash In = (Appropriated funds ($87.800M) + Fees $269.293M) = $357.093M; Cash Out = $309.636M; therefore ROI = $357.093M-$309.636M/$309.636M = 15.3%.  The details for this method are included in the first tab of the TWIC Funding History report which is uploaded. The program has been in Operations and Maintenance since October 2008. The program's external benefits include providing a biometric credential to over 3.0 million transportation workers as of May 31, 2014. TWIC is one part of the layered approach to port security and establishes a minimum, uniform, vetting and threat assessment requirements for mariners and port workers across the country.  The nationwide recognition of TWIC as the one common credential needed to allow a worker unescorted access to secure areas of facilities and vessels enables facility and vessel operators to verify the identity of individuals, including the use of biometrics-steps that were not feasible prior to TWIC implementation with potentially thousands of different facility-specific credentials.  The credential is being used in over 2500 MTSA-regulated maritime facilities and vessels nationwide.  Through the use of a universally accepted common access card, the TWIC system has eliminated the duplicative costs associated with redundant credentials and application processes, thereby reducing costs to the individual transportation worker. In addition, a simplified program supports efficient execution and a reduced threat window.","2014: Enrolled over 3.0 million transportation workers to date with 268,327 enrollments in FY2014 as of May 31, 2014. Enrollment centers open and operational 98% of the time through May 31, 2014. Qualified Technology List (QTL) now includes 1 fixed reader and 6 mobile readers as of June 15, 2014. An additional 7 fixed readers are under testing. Continued comprehensive stakeholder outreach program. Completed the pilot program of the OneVisit initiative which provided OneVisit enrollments to Alaska and selected sites in Michigan. Nationwide rollout of OneVisit commenced in May 2014. Funded Interagency Agreement with GPO to assume TWIC card production services GPO. Actively supported the transition from the TWIC Legacy System to the TIM System.

STIP stakeholders include:  Airlines; airport authorities; local, state and federal law enforcement organizations; local, state and federal regulatory agencies; vendors; TSA Office of Security Operations (OSO), including Federal Security Directors (FSD) and their staff; Office of Security Capabilities (OSC), including the Mission Analysis Division (MAD), Deployment Division, Checkpoint Technologies Division (CTD), Checked Baggage Technologies Division (CBTD), and the Operations Support Division (OS); Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA); Maintenance Service Providers (MSPs); and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Support Contractors, Air Carriers, Airport Authorities, American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), Air Transportation Association (ATA), Airport Council International - North America (ACINA), International Air Transport Association (IATA).STIP supports the DHS mission and aligns to the QHSR in Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security, Ensuring Resilience to Disasters and Maturing and Strengthening the DHS enterprise through its strategic objectives, resulting in enhanced benefits to the stakeholders noted above.  Benefits include:1. STIP has the ability to push software updates from a central location to TSE in the field programmatically, significantly reducing the time to implement these updates. 2. Improve property management and configuration control by providing the automated capabilities necessary to maintain a higher level of standardization and oversight of equipment operations.3. Improve the timeliness and accuracy of checkpoint and checked baggage information by automating and centralizing the collection and management of operational and performance data.  STIP does not share data with other components at this time but is designed to enable future integration as capabilities mature. Currently, the data flows that are being managed are contained completely within the domain of the STIP system, i.e. within and amongst the screening machines and the STIP central servers.","024-023 : In-Flight Security","STIP aligns with DHS and TSA's target enterprise architecture (EA). It contributes to the agency EA by leveraging the existing network to automate and reduce the number of manual jobs that the workforce currently performs on a daily basis, such as data collection and equipment maintenance. STIP was included in the DHS Joint Portfolio Review for 2012, and received a recommendation to proceed.   STIP introduces new and innovative capabilities that enhance TSA's ability to conduct proactive maintenance on deployed machines through the Remote Monitoring and Maintenance (RMM) capability and associated Maintenance Ticketing Application (MTA). RMM/MTA will enable early detection of critical issues as TSE reach threshold parameters and automatically notify maintenance service providers (MSPs) of the issue. Conducting early and proactive maintenance on equipment, and introducing remote troubleshooting and maintenance capabilities, will result in significant cost savings for TSA and minimize the impact of TSE maintenance issues on airport operations.","'The ROI of 119% indicates that STIP is a performing program that, when fully implemented, external benefits will increase such that the initial acquisition costs will be recovered and the program will return $1.19 for every acquisition dollar invested. The initial STIP CBA was conducted in 2006. The current ROI is derived from the 2009 STIP CBA update, which updated the most current costs and expected benefits for the selected alternative.  Benefits of STIP include a significant reduction in maintenance costs for PSP and EBSP through two main capabilities: (1) Remote Monitoring and Maintenance (RMM) enables Maintenance Service Providers (MSPs) to receive automated notification through the STIP Maintenance Ticketing Application (MTA) when a TSE reaches a critical threshold parameter indicating a maintenance event; the MSP is then able to achieve efficiencies in on-site maintenance through remote triage prior to the technician arriving at the TSE, or by conducting all required maintenance from a remote location, reducing man-hours and machine down-time; (2) Remote software and configuration updates from the STIP Enterprise Manager eliminate the need for TSE to be manually-upgraded each time a new software version is available or a configuration update is required. Through STIP, TSA is able to achieve efficiencies in TSE maintenance that result in significant cost savings, fully outweighing all investment costs related to the program. The ROI is calculated by dividing the net benefit by capital and non-recurring investment costs, subtracting one, and converting the remaining figure to a percentage. A positive ROI indicates that the purchase and implementation of new capital assets to create a new capability should result in a net reduction in recurring costs over the investment lifecycle greater than the total of the original non-recurring costs required to create said capability.","STIP continued functionality development for enterprise applications & STIP software upgrades for TSE.

The SF Program supports Mission 1 of the DHS Strategic Plan, Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security, by operating a threat-based, watch-list matching capability that enhances the security of domestic and international commercial air travel by vetting more than 2 million aircraft passengers a day. SF's goals are to: prevent individuals on the No Fly List from boarding an aircraft; identify individuals on the Selectee List for enhanced screening; support TSA's risk-based security mission by identifying high-risk passengers for appropriate security measures/actions and identifying low-risk passengers for expedited screening; minimize misidentification of individuals as potential threats to aviation security; incorporate additional risk-based security capabilities to streamline processes and accommodate additional aviation populations; and protect passengers' personal information from unauthorized use and disclosure. A key benefit from this investment is that SF provides a consistent approach to meeting these goals. The traveling public is SF's primary customer. SF uses trained analysts, stakeholder coordination, and technological capabilities to identify passengers who match the watch list and to promote aviation security for the traveling public. SF provides earlier insight into potential matches to the watch list. The SF Operations Center (SOC) provides extensive benefits to the TSA mission through its 24/7 monitoring of potential matches to the watch list. SF integrates DHS redress results into the watch-list matching process to help prevent future delays of misidentified passengers. SF also supports the TSA Pre-Check program, which is a key TSA initiative to provide expedited airport security checkpoint screening to pre-screened passengers.  Besides the public, SF stakeholders include aircraft operators, aviation industry trade associations and industry groups, third-party service providers, and privacy advocacy groups. Government stakeholders include TSA, the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, the FBI, the Terrorist Screening Center, and the Federal Aviation Administration.","024-023 : In-Flight Security","The Secure Flight (SF) program aligns with TSA's target Enterprise Architecture (EA) and DHS Enterprise Architecture Board. The technology mapping was reviewed and approved by DHS EA to support the SF Joint Portfolio Review. Besides adhering to the TSA Enterprise-approved TRM, Secure Flight also complies with applicable DHS EA requirements including, but not limited to, complying with vetting framework, Federal Data Standards, NIST standards, NIEM compliance, etc.  SF architecture has also adopted DHS best practices for reusability including optimizing the use of DHS CBP router for airline connectivity. Secure Flight will continue to innovate its Enterprise Architecture and IT solutions to evolve and use newly defined architecture paradigms to support well-encapsulated, loosely coupled, reusable, net-centrically discoverable and callable services to reflect Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) business processes.  SOA services have included (both as consumer and provider) Watch List Service, Encounter Management Service, and List Management Service, which includes ODNI, DoD, Federal Judges, and CBP's Global Entry System.","SF program's return on investment cannot be measured in terms of dollars, because the benefits are intangible in that they relate to preventing an act of terrorism from occurring. The return on investment from SF, therefore, is the strengthening of national security provided by the program's real-time name matching and vetting services.  SF adds value to the national security and counterterrorism mission by identifying high- and low-risk passengers in order to mitigate known and unknown threats to aviation security and designate them for standard screening, expedited screening, or prohibition from boarding a covered flight, as appropriate. SF works closely with industry, other agencies, and stakeholders to ensure compliance with the SF Final Rule, which became effective on December 29, 2008. The SF program was created in response to the 9/11 Commission recommendation and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act requiring TSA to assume watch-list matching from aircraft operators. Since 11/23/10, SF has conducted watch-list matching for all covered aircraft operators with flights into, out of, and within the United States, as well as for covered US aircraft operator flights between two international points (Overflights). This benefits the traveling public, US Government agencies with equities (e.g., DHS, DOJ, CBP), and the aviation industry.","In PY, SF began a shift from a one-size-fits-all method of screening in favor of procedures designed to manage or mitigate risk, in keeping with TSA's goal of delivering the most effective security solution in the most efficient manner. The SF program is focusing resources to improve the passenger experience at airport security checkpoints by applying new intelligence-driven, risk-based screening procedures that align with TSA's risk-based security initiative, which includes TSA Pre-Check at select airports to offer pre-screening to travelers.  SF has also deployed Watch List Service to receive near-real-time transmission of watch-list data from the Terrorist Screening Center; supported testing of systems used by the existing aircraft operators for major system modifications; implemented testing of existing aircraft operator migration to new service providers; and implemented the start-up process for newly covered aircraft operators.","For CY15, Secure Flight (SF) will continue refining its system to ensure efficient, accurate, and reliable watch-list matching; expand to additional aviation and other populations; and strengthen tools used by the Secure Flight Operations Center (SOC) to improve performance metrics.  For BY16, the SF program will perform the following:1.  Expand to additional aviation populations by working with remaining covered foreign air carriers to submit passenger data for overflights. 2.  Complete Phase III of the multi-phased Twelve-Five and Private Charter Pilot Program to transfer watch-list matching functions for all regulated General Aviation (GA) operators to SF. This pilot program made SF available to a limited number of voluntary Twelve-Five Standard Security Program and Private Charter Standard Security Program operators in order to understand how SF can best serve them and additional GA operators. Now that the pilot has concluded and once the Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and General Aviation Final Rule has been published, SF will work with GA operators (including twelve-five and private charters) to conduct outreach, testing, and onboarding, and to achieve full operational capability.3.  Continue supporting TSA's risk-based, intelligence-driven approach to transportation security through continued system modifications to expand TSA PreCheck membership to additional populations (i.e., National Fusion Center Association and TSA employees). This enables SF to effectively deploy resources against high-risk passengers, while easing the travel of low-risk passengers by providing such benefits as not needing to remove shoes, laptop, belt or outerwear.4.  Initiate support for credential and boarding pass authentication at the checkpoint.For FY16 and out years, SF will continue refining its system to ensure efficient, accurate, and reliable watch list matching; implement further risk-based security initiatives, expand to additional aviation populations, and strengthen tools used by the SOC to improve performance metrics.","yes","yes","yes","no","no","no","no","no","","yes","719.503000","98.947000","112.003000","105.097000","2001","2023","There are no significant changes to the funding levels for PY or CY.","The majority of Secure Flight contracts are either Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).

The TIM Program mission is aligned and consistent with the overarching DHS and TSA mission, DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security.  TIM System is supporting operations by reducing the probability of a successful terrorist attack on the transportation system by applying threat assessment methodologies intended to identify known or suspected terrorist threats working in or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system. TIM is being built and operated in the DHS datacenter cloud environment to be a fully integrated system utilizing service oriented architecture capable of providing more effective and efficient security threat assessments to all areas of the transportation sector including, surface, maritime and aviation areas.  Using Service Oriented Architecture in the cloud environment, TIM provides services to maritime and is being expanded to serve surface and aviation transportation programs.  TIM has become the infrastructure focal point for stakeholders including; Congress, FBI, State Department, Coast Guard, State & Local agencies, U.S. airports, U.S. ports, transportation employers & unions.  The goals are to improve customer service, one-stop shopping, person-centric view to enroll, once and use many, increase efficiency of security threat assessments and information sharing with federal, state & local and industry partners promoting secure operations, support fee-fairness and comparability between credentials for the millions of transportation workers; realize economies of scale; and operational efficiencies through integration of processes.  TIM customers (transportation workers and travelers) will benefit from the efficiencies and cost avoidance once TIM is fully implemented.  Workers experience improved service at a lower cost.  TIM is poised to be an Enterprise-level solution for Screening Coordination Office (SCO) Credentialing Framework Initiatives (CFI).  TIM is one of the first DHS programs to use DHS Data Center Cloud Services TIM is paving the way for new security and data sharing methodologies.  TIM enables agile responses to changing business conditions and operational requirements via engineered business processes, seamless information sharing services based on managed data (accurate, timely, trustable) with tuned IT performance.","024-025 : Intermodal Screening Operations","The TIM Program mission is enabling the protection of the nation's critical transportation infrastructure from criminal and terrorist attacks by replacing current legacy systems with an integrated end-to-end solution that manages enrollments, credentials, and vetting assessment results for millions of transportation sector workers and travelers. This mission is aligned and consistent with the overarching DHS and TSA mission, DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security.  TIM falls within the DHS's Screening Segment and provides functionality supporting primary functions, People Screening and Credential Management. From the DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog Version 1.0, TIM supports Enroll Party, Vet Party, Adjudicate Party, and Confirm Benefits in the Screening & Scanning Functional Area. The TIM Program is interfacing with other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) information services, including those of the Screening Coordination Office (SCO), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Visitor and Immigration Status Indictor Technology (US-VISIT), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and others as appropriate. The TIM Program will also interface with other federal agencies as necessary, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), and other critical federal infrastructure.  The TIM Program is establishing all agreements necessary for interfacing and exchanging information with each agency.  The TIM operational requirements are to improve and streamline credentialing services to simplify the process into a universal credentialing services, enable information sharing across DHS, improve the management and timely processing of Security Threat Assessments (STA), and produce tamper-resistant credentials to support multiple licenses, privileges, or statuses within a single physical credential.  The TIM System employs a service-oriented architecture (SOA) that fully addresses the operational requirements of current TSA legacy credentialing programs in a flexible and scalable manner.  This architecture will enable agile responses to changing business conditions and operational requirements via engineered business processes, seamless information sharing services based on managed data (accurate, timely, trustable), and tuned IT infrastructure (DHS Data Center Cloud Services).","TIM is a Performing Program.  The TIM Program will eliminate redundant business practices, processes, and achieve significant economies of scale benefits associated with a unifying business integration effort.  TIM enables support for Maritime, Surface,  and Aviation transportation worker / traveler populations.Internal cost and performance efficiencies will be achieved by streamlined business integration of now separate IT systems (TWIC, Consolidated Screening Gateway, Hazardous Materials Endorsement Threat Assessment Program, Crew Vetting, Alien Flight Student Program) functionality under TIM.  TIM will enable information sharing across TSA / DHS.  The TIM Program will interface with other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) information services and federal agencies to establish all agreements necessary for interfacing and exchanging information. The TIM system is being built in the cloud environment at the DHS datacenters, significant cost avoidance will be realized in the future years when the system is in the O&M phase.  External stakeholders benefit from streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person centric.  TIM is a person centric system that recognizes workers applying for multiple credentials, endorsements, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation or commercial modes.  This comparability capability enables TSA to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities and saves users time and money.    The STA process uses the biometric and biographic information to conduct an automated immigration check, a criminal history check and finger print check, and a terrorist watch list check.  The approved STA is required for the worker to start/continue work or to apply for a job, any significant delays impact the worker and may impact commerce. TIM Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE), August 2011, is the authoritative source for this cost analysis of TIM DME Investment and TIM operating costs. TIM Benefit Analysis projected savings is calculated by subtraction of the TIM LCCE operating cost forecast from the As Is Baseline as defined in the TIM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The savings are calculated annually between 2014 and 2025.  The accumulated savings is $397M through 2025.  The ROI is 53%.

The remaining builds (projects) will address surface business and technical services (fourth quarter of FY2015) and aviation business and technical services with the FOC scheduled for the second quarter FY2016. At FOC in FY2016, TIM will be providing services to traveler and transportation worker populations covering Maritime, Surface, and Aviation transportation modes. For FY2015, to meet TSA priorities, the Surface increment has been expanded to include TSA PreCheck and Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS).  The TSA PreCheck initiative has developed into an effective security program at 118 airports nationwide. The PreCheck application program to date has received 180,000 applications at the 240-plus application centers nationwide. RBS has also enabled TSA to become more efficient and has achieved $100 million in savings by enabling trusted passengers to more quickly move through the checkpoint.  Currently forecast to be over 1 million identities with benefits by 2015.The Surface increment also includes Hazardous Materials transportation workers. Within the U.S. transportation network nearly 800,000 shipments of hazardous materials are transported every day (95 percent by truck); more than 140,000 miles of railroad track; 3.8 million miles of roads; 582,000 bridges spanning over 20 feet;  54 tunnels over 19,685 feet in length; and nearly 2.5 million miles of pipeline.  With the completion of the Surface increment, TIM will be managing over 5 million identities with benefits by the end of FY2015.The Aviation increment in FY2016 supports workers that are screening of 640 million passengers annually.  The addition of the transportation worker populations screening cargo and travelers will increase the identities with benefits to exceed over 10 million by the end of FY2016.With full migration of transportation populations and continued growth the TIM identities are conservatively forecast to exceed 15 million by the end of FY2017 and over 20 million by the end of FY2020.

An EVM IPT is actively reviewing monthly TIM Cost Performance Reports (CPR) and monthly contractor Program Management Review (PMR) documentation.  In addition the TIM Integrated Management Schedule (IMS) is reviewed to assess impacts on the critical path.  An Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) is developed and maintained as an integral part of the program's Earned Value Management (EVM) System. The IMS includes all activities, resources, and timelines in support of the program. The IMS is a set of separate schedules representing the work of contractors and government staff, networked together through external links. Many of the other smaller contracts do not require EVM because of the contract type.  The majority of contracts are Firm Fixed Price.EVM is not a requirement for any of the other contracts or task orders above; however the TIM EVM IPT meets weekly on a monthly cycle conducting reviews of the Design and Development contractor, Accenture, progress management deliverables: Weekly Status Report, Contract Funds Status Report (CFSR), Cost Performance Reporting (CPR), Program Management Review (PMR), and the associated Integrated Management Schedule (IMS).  The TIM EVM IPT provides performance oversight and management of systems engineering, systems integration, interface activities, and transition to identify cost and/or schedule overruns and to provide a forecast of final cost and schedule outcomes.   Since the IBR held in December 2012, the iterative development of providing streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person centric has been measured and analyzed to ensure it provides major trending information to the Program Manager for use in decision-making.  TIM is now completing migration of Maritime, the TWIC population.  Currently both cumulative CPI and SPI are very close to 1 and the EAC is within budget.  The TIM EVM IPT adheres to EVM standard which require that EVM integrates the technical performance requirements with the elements of cost and schedule.  Each incremental population / set of populations in the Surface and Aviation transportation modes will have an IBR and integrate the statement of work, schedule, and cost to create an aggregate picture of performance, which helps ensure that day-to-day decisions on performance for development efforts are consistent with program objectives.","2","The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) program is in the Mixed life cycle phase.

The Surface and Aviation segments are preparing for an Acquisition Review Board (ARB) during Q3 FY15 for an Acquisition Decision Event ADE-2B re-basline decision. The complexity of these risks has caused TIM to operate outside of its approved baseline. The resulting breach is from deficiencies in the following major areas: 1) Requirements, 2) Contracts, 3) Operations, 4) Performance and 5) Organizational changes. Contract issues have resulted from estimates based on out of date technical inputs and vendor quotes. The Life Cycle Cost Estimate assumptions are no longer valid. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is not aligned with the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS).

In support of the Security Technology Integrated Program (STIP) - STIP relies on TOP to provide the IT operating environment and associated infrastructure - ITIP effectively supported the agency-wide data management system providing the centralized focal point connecting passenger and baggage screening security technologies to the Enterprise Manager (EM) addressing current data, threat response, and equipment challenges. Additionally ITIP played a leading role in the implementation of Video Teleconferencing to enhance field communications at airports and offsite facilities, 129 video teleconferencing mobile carts were procured and fielded. These units will provide FAMS employees the ability to conduct multi-party video calls with other TSA field locations and TSA HQ, improving normal communications as well as threat response and coordination.","In FY15 the Information technology Infrastructure Program (ITIP) will continue the active deployment of the Transportation Security Administration router refresh, secure mobile computing, and enterprise-wide desktop refresh. The Router Refresh project will enable TSA to improve its security posture and enhance data processing capability. ITIP plays a leading role in the Data Center Migration initiative to consolidated data center creating efficiencies.  During FY13 DHS awarded the hardware and software procurement for the migration of the TSA Data Center in Atlantic City (ACY), meeting milestones linked to the DHS Data Center Consolidation mandate.  ITIP also leads the Telecomm Integration-In FY13 FAMS and the General Services Administration (GSA) worked to integrate TSA and FAMS telecommunications services, improving transparency into network configuration management and streamlining the acquisition process. Consolidation will be completed by 2014. The out years (FY15/16) will see ITIP fully engage in support of numerous initiatives.  Three of these are 1. Credential Authentication Technology-The Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) automatically authenticates identity documents that are presented to TSA by passengers during the security checkpoint screening process. Early last year, TSA issued a Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research to better understand capabilities available in industry for CAT. TSA anticipates that the new technology will enhance security and increase efficiency by automatically verifying passenger identification and obtaining the passenger's vetting status. 2. Advanced Imaging Technology - Advanced imaging technology safely screens passengers for metallic and nonmetallic threats, including weapons and explosives, which may be concealed under clothing without physical contact to help TSA keep the traveling public safe.

This investment meets this statutory mandate and conducts a security threat assessment  for those that seek to apply for,  renew or transfer a HME on a  state-issued CDL. Purpose: to deliver a capability to assess risk through leveraging intelligence data, criminal history and immigration status information in order to effectively identify persons known or suspected to pose a threat to transportation security. The primary goal is to protect the national transportation system, through identifying and prohibiting high risk persons from holding a hazardous materials endorsement (HME), identifying low risk persons as eligible to possess a HME, and minimizing misidentifications of individuals as potential threats.Contribution to Mission Delivery or Agency Management Support Functions: In accordance with DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog, Version 1.0, dated January 2013, HTAP program supports PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY, Mission and Screening function as listed in the Capability Portfolio by improving/standardizing the STA performed to determine if a commercial driver should be allowed to transport hazardous material. More than 2.37 million drivers have been vetted.Key customers, stakeholders & beneficiaries are US citizens, commercial trucking industry, carriers and trade associations, commercial truck drivers and state DMVs.Historically the endorsement process for transport of hazardous materials focused on the state's driver safety record and reducing risk of a Hazmat incident. HTAP assumed the responsibility of conducting uniform security threat assessments, ensuring a consistent approach to identify known or suspected terrorists.  The process is proven to be more timely & accurate than methods previously utilized.Primary benefits relate to improved efficiency and processes. By implementing improvements and enhancing system capabilities, anticipated benefits include decreased time, work and costs required for the vetting process during the comparability/ vetting process, and increased data quality. A redress process is included.  Goals: timeliness, accuracy and efficiency, completing the adjudication process within 30 days; YTD average is 99% within 30 days or less; fingerprint reject rate is less than 0.4%.","024-025 : Intermodal Screening Operations","The Hazmat Program received a Proceed recommendation during the FY2014 Joint Portfolio Review and was one of the top rated programs. Hazmat is also included in an enterprise wide segment architecture planning activity and is included in the transition plan. The Hazmat investment received a score of 5 from the DHS CIO review conducted in June 2012. Additionally a DHS CIO review was  conducted in July 2013, with this investment identified as a low risk. Besides adhering to the TSA Enterprise approved TRM, HTAP also complies with applicable DHS EA requirements including but not limited to complying with vetting framework, Federal Data Standards, NIST standards, etc. HTAP architecture has also adopted DHS best practices of reusability by utilizing multiple exiting TSA interfaces for vetting system integration. HTAP also leverages standard communication methods and security protocols.  HTAP is one of several programs that plan to migrate in in FY15 to TIM which will consolidate operations by integrating program-specific information technology systems and business processes into a common secure enterprise vetting and credentialing architecture.  Technical innovation will be incorporated into the design of TIM, and thus achieved when the program back end services migrate to the TIM platform.  The TIM system will be scalable and flexible IT platform based on Federal Enterprise Architecture Service Component Based architecture. TIM will align and integrate processes, services and infrastructure by developing an end to end system to management the STA process. The TIM will help the program achieve programmatic  and technical innovation by consolidating services and by use of cloud computing and Service Oriented Architecture.","As this investment has been operational since 2005, recovery of the initial investment has been realized. As this is a fee-based program, the fee charged may cover services performed: threat assessment fees may be equal to threat assessment expenses since the government may not make a profit on services rendered. Hazmat Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) return on investment cannot be measured in terms of dollars because of the intangible benefits that related to preventing acts of terrorism from occurring. The value that HTAP provides cannot be measured in monetary terms since it is providing matching and vetting services and strengthens national security by identifying high and low risk persons in order to mitigate known and unknown threats involved in the transport of hazardous materials.  This program provides quantifiable societal benefits by reducing the risk of terrorist events and the resulting economic impact if a government-controlled watch list and threat assessment process is not implemented. Benefits attributable to the capability are assumed to be a small portion of the cost of damages that would result from not preventing a terrorist from transporting hazardous materials. Additionally, this investment provides the following qualitative benefits to user groups for which the capability has been implemented:1. Enables strict security controls2. In non-agent states, leverages DMV infrastructure for transmittal/receipt of results prior to HME endorsement issuance3. Integrates automated watch list matching and manual review and resolution of near matches.4. Reduces organization complexity and simplifies integration, program control and management.","Accomplishments include system sustainment to meet operational and business requirements and continued support to complete all security threat assessments and O & M activities.

The TSA's mission is to protect the Nation's transportation systems. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) mission is to detect, deter, and defeat hostile acts targeting U.S. air carriers, airports, passengers, and crews. The purpose of the Mission Scheduling and Notification System (MSNS) is to provide mission-critical, operational information support for the FAMS. The goal of MSNS is to help ensure that the FAMS is able to execute its transportation safety mission easily and efficiently, while providing system flexibility and evolving capabilities to meet changing mission needs in the coming years. Some of the current benefits of MSNS include its specific contributions to the FAMS mission: 1) It automatically determines allocation of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) to flights using Industry-leading planning and manpower allocation software which incorporates TSA's risk-based strategies, FAMS policies, and individual FAM limitations;2) It automatically coordinates and communicates mission assignments with Operations, Field Offices, and FAM personnel;3) It automatically reserves, changes, and cancels airline tickets; 4) Its automatic reservation and ticketing causes less disruption to the airline industry over manual methods;5) It automatically tracks mission execution and supports operational changes to previous plans;6) It provides live fail-over, disaster recovery, and Continuity of Operations (COOP) capabilities to ensure FAMS mission-critical information is available annually 99.999% of the time, 24x7x365;7) It facilitates a smaller and stronger security perimeter around operational information by reducing the number of people needed to accomplish tasks in the FAMS mission. The key customers of MSNS are FAMS leadership, operations and the individual FAMs. Other stakeholders include the TSA Office of Information Technology (OIT), TSA and DHS leadership, the U.S. Congress, and the President of the United States. Other beneficiaries are U.S. air carriers, airplane passengers, airports, and U.S. citizens. The outcome of MSNS is needed to enable the FAMS to efficiently and effectively provide air transportation security, thus fulfilling the FAMS mission, part of the TSA mission, and Mission 1 of DHS.","024-023 : In-Flight Security","Mission Scheduling and Notification System (MSNS) is a specialized capability, employing advanced algorithms for scheduling and high availability for FAM tracking, around the world. In the enterprise roadmap, MSNS represents a Mission System capability. MSNS is not an infrastructure or general support system, it is a capability specifically designed and implemented to support an element of mission execution. In terms of program innovation, in FY13, MSNS kicked off a modernization of existing scheduling capabilities. In addition to the core capabilities, MSNS has, in terms of  innovation, supported and incorporated advanced risk based scheduling determination in the Intelligent Randomization In Scheduling (IRIS) capability developed originally by DHS Science and Technology. This capability is a recipient of the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA) award for excellence.","This technology investment, based on a further 5 years of utility, results in a net benefit of 5*$30.7M = $153.4M.

Net benefit was calculated based on input from FAMS Flight Operations division, and includes only (unloaded) salary costs of personnel for a manual alternative, and does not include any quality benefit. This ROI represents an extremely conservative calculation of the total program value. Quoting from the FAMS Flight Operations alternative cost estimation,  QUOTE. The cost in both dollars and personnel would be significant if we were to perform SOCS associated operations without the use of the MSNS applications.

The purpose and goal of TVS is to provide TSA the ability to conduct initial and recurrent name-based matching against defined terrorist related data sets of individuals regulated by TSA who require access to transportation infrastructure and determine if they pose a threat to transportation across the various modes and the homeland. The benefit of the investment is an added layer of security and contributes directly to TSA's mission of protecting the homeland and detect potential threats to transportation infrastructure. TVS was originally intended to conduct biographic matching of flight crew members that fly into, out of and over US airspace. Over time, the technology supporting the vetting or name-based background checks were leveraged to support the vetting of other transportation related populations regulated by TSA. To date, TVS's infrastructure conducts vetting for all individuals regulated under TSA's maritime, surface and aviation security programs. It also, provides watchlist service for Secure Flight program and supports the Office of Intelligence's Encounter Management Division. Specifically TVS's infrastructure help to identify potential threats posed by individuals to transportation infrastructure by conducting initial and recurrent vets of more than 35 million individuals across the transportation infrastructure in a highly efficient, effective and scalable environment. Key customers, stakeholders and beneficiaries of TVS include international flight crews, port workers, hazardous material drivers, airport workers, air carriers, indirect air carriers for access to cargo, other federal government entities and agencies, transportation related associations and advocacy groups. The vetting infrastructure, recently renamed the Transportation Vetting System (TVS) is to be managed by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA). It is anticipated that TVS will be service the Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) effort underway beginning (calendar yr) 2014 and is expected to be fully interfaced in (calendar year) 2016 when TIM becomes fully operational for vetting services.","024-025 : Intermodal Screening Operations","'TVS (CVPS) was reviewed by the Department as a part of the DHS Screening Portfolio Review on May 14, 2012. At that time, CVPS was granted approval to proceed. DHS noted concerns regarding the CVP funding until FY14, with an exception that the TIM and TVS will be implemented.  This interface was successfully implemented in 2Q14 in support of TIM IOC. The TVS (CVP) vetting infrastructure conducts name-based biographic data matching (vetting) on individuals with access to transportation related infrastructure to ensure they do not pose a threat to transportation or national security. The program is key to the vetting services that TSA uses across transportation modes. TVS, which is currently in the operations and maintenance phase, provides 24/7 technical capability to conduct name-based terrorism, immigration and criminal background checks on individuals with access to airports, airplanes, ports and hazardous materials. TVS  ensures that flight crew members who fly into, out of or over US airspace are not a potential threat to aviation security. In addition to international flight crews, the TVS vetting infrastructure has been leveraged and modified across the Component to support background checks for other TSA regulated transportation sectors to protect the homeland. TVS system conducts name-based vetting for port workers, chemical factory workers, TSA personnel, hazardous material drivers, general aviation flight crews, FAA airman certificate holders and air cargo workers. In terms of innovation, TVS is both a vetting and intelligence platform within TSA. The TVS infrastructure and technology platform provides TSA flexibility and economies of scale by providing a centralized, high-speed, high-volume, scalable, adaptable resource available to all anti-terrorism screening programs across the federal government (such as the FAA). As TVS's vetting infrastructure is in steady state O&M stage, the investment is focused on interfacing with the Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) effort. Through TIM, a centralized, standardized and enterprise wide vetting and credentialing system will be delivered.","The critical mission of TVS is Preventing Terrorism. Every day, preventing known/suspected terrorists from gaining trusted access to the nation's transportation and critical infrastructure. TVS is the TSA's Vetting System, carries out recurrent vetting of over 4 million records daily and over 35 million TSA regulated population annually. The recurrent vetting, immediately alerts users on suspects and enables TSA/DHS to protect the people, commerce and infrastructure from an act of terrorism. TVS conducts real-time vetting of Flight Crew for flight to/from and over United States preventing known/suspected terrorist from flying. TVS vetting results aided in providing over 2 million Credentials for Transportation Workers to obtain employment in the Maritime industry, and clearances to over 4 million applicants to enable them to obtain HAZMAT/Commercial Driver's License. It also provides Watchlist update service to Secure Flight, enabling efficient Secure Flight operations. The vetting benefits are derived from the following alerts to protect against terror threats: (1) subject-to-watchlist match alerts signifying a subject may be on a watchlist; (2) subject-to-subject link alerts signifying a subject who is not on a watchlist may be somehow related to subject who is on a watchlist; (3) subject-to-other match alerts signifying the subject data may contain purposefully deceptive information; and, (4) subject-to-subject match alerts signifying that two or more subject records may represent the same individual; (5) subject-to-encounter match alert signifying that a person may have been also encountered by a partner organization; (6) subject-to-encounter link alert signifying that a person may be somehow linked to a person encountered by a partner organization. (7) BOLO (Be On the Look Out) match alerts signifying that a system record of any type may match an individual on a Be On the Look Out list.  The value TVS provides cannot be measured in real monetary value, because the benefits are intangible benefits.","The Transportation Vetting System IT infrastructure's  vetting platform/engine continues to provide TSA the capability to conduct vetting/recurrent vetting of over 35 million individuals on an annual basis covering more than 30 plus separate populations ranging from port workers, hazmat material drivers, chemical factory workers, TSA personnel and individuals requesting access to all aspects of aviation infrastructures. The infrastructure has the capability to on-board new population on demand, recurrently vet all individuals on a daily basis with any changes to terrorism related derogatory datasets and maintain 24/7 operational capabilities. There have been no failures or breakdown in service of the vetting capabilities and continues to conduct name based checks over 32 plus populations on a recurrent basis.","The Transportation Vetting System's vetting engine will continue to expand its vetting capabilities as needed and required by TSA.

To support this mission TSA has taken a number of actions, one of which was to build the Performance Management Information System (PMIS). The program Mission Need Statement (MNS) was formally approved on 04/19/05. An initial priority was to field data collection and data reporting applications. PMIS now readily supports end-user report creation with the MicroStrategy Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) application as well as report sharing, providing greater capability and control to the various locations in the field as well as Headquarters program offices.  Benefits include greater efficiency and effectiveness to be able to target potential threats through the use of AIMStakeholders include the General Accounting Office (GAO), DHS Inspector General (DHS IG), FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, Census Bureau, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), US Congress, Federal Reserve Board (FRB) , United States Postal Service (USPS), and the Media (through Freedom of Information Act and TSA's Strategic Office of Communications and Public Affairs). Beneficiaries of the data include TSA Headquarters Offices and Airport Leadership. Specific contributions include information and metrics including Airport Customer Throughput, Customer Throughput, Wait Time, and other key performance metrics. Internally, the program supports integrated data collection and operational performance reporting. The program has worked to enable greater levels of self-service across the TSA enterprise.  The innovative Airport Information Management (AIM) modules provides real-time business intelligence for operational performance, and is customizable at the airport level by Federal Security Director designated AIM Site Administrators.TSA has a need expand this capability to other offices for greater information sharing, leveraging the existing asset to continue to enable operational activities both in the field and at TSA HQ for real-time reporting. Sharing knowledge and lessons learned will provide TSA users with the information needed to improve their decision making processes. TSA is now better able to leverage end user inputs into solid data entry and business rule requirements, allowing greater security controls for data submissions as well as specific data. This program is in Support.","000-000 : (Primary Program Not Available)","PMIS aligns with TSA's target Enterprise Architecture (EA) and DHS Enterprise Architecture Board. The mappings were reviewed by DHS EA in preparation for the 2014 Enterprise Business Services Joint Portfolio Review. Residing on the TSA's Operating Platform (TOP), PMIS leverages data from source systems and provides an innovative real-time business intelligence solution for data collection and operational performance. This investment fuses and combines data entry into and with classic business intelligence. The innovative capability creates efficiencies for reporting and analysis, as well cost savings. The integrated solution offers a great deal of self-service business intelligence through enhanced data management and information quality. The solution incorporates business processes and provides privacy and security.This investment aligns to the federal enterprise architecture coordinates specifically with TSA Enterprise Architecture areas of focus through the Shared Services Workgroup.  This effort will provide a framework of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve without the ownership of specific cost and risk. The expected result is an analysis that will provide key inputs to a Service Management Framework that assists DHS with development, implementation, and management of Enterprise IT Services.  In 2016 we will work to identify processes and tools that are being utilized to capture data and information that will categorize and classify services.  The initial focus will be with defined sources of data that can be shared with other TSA offices and federal agencies.  Data as a Service (DAAS) offers a documented approach to reuse existing assets, providing consistency and supporting TSA Enterprise Architecture principles.  The Shared Services Workgroup focus is on identifying the key processes and activities from ITIL v3 to incorporate into a DHS Service Lifecycle (SLC) while paying attention to the people, processes, and tools needed to perform the activities.  The PMIS Program has supported real time collaborative efforts with Sandia Labs and Los Alamos National Labs.The PMIS Program has participated on the Shared Services Workgroup to document specific business needs with supporting operational directives, standard operating procedures, and regulations, as well as collection point, shared service, and transformation.","TSA installed the MicroStrategy software in 2004 and has spent the last nine years creating a series of performance-based solutions including real-time business intelligence.  Using the MicroStrategy tool, OSO created the Management Objective Reports (MOR), a report generated for over 160 airports each pay period.  MicroStrategy generated over 2800 pages of performance data each pay period, and since FY07 has documented cost savings and cost avoidance of over $300m.  The MOR has been used by TSA Leadership to establish targets for a series of performance measures, both efficiency measures as well as effectiveness measures.  A copy of the AIM Cost Benefit Survey is attached.  The AIM Return On Investment (ROI) average annual Airport savings of $38,185 for many of the functions within the current AIM module suite. This translates to $17,183,500 for all 450 Nationwide airports annually.   TSA employees are no longer creating and maintaining separate databases at each airport for the AIM modules.","The PMIS Program continues to support and expand self-service capabilities to users. In 2014, the PMIS Program was able to accomplish additional objectives through the upgrade of the Business Intelligence tool, with additional real-time reporting using multisource. There were over 5m reports generated and additional enhancements and improvements were completed to track Leadership Priorities and Objectives as well as provide dialogue for both recognition and adjustment. AIM users generated 300k pre-filled forms upon demand, reducing time and errors with the prior manual process. Participation continued in the TSA Shared Services Workgroup and meetings with DHS, FEMA, and CBP. The PMIS Program received positive feedback from DHS leadership in 2014: It is really impressive and surely a best practice in the Department. I will be sure to let others know of this resource.

The PAWSS was Congressionally Mandated to modernize Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) in five ports (New York (NY). Houston/Galveston (HG), San Francisco (SF), Prince William Sound (PWS), and Puget Sound (PS)) and introduce automated VTS systems in four other ports (Lower Mississippi River (LMR), Sault Ste. Marie (SSM) Berwick Bay (BB), and Port Arthur (PA)) through the use of commercially available technology including Automatic Identification System (AIS), Radars, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV), and voice communications.Benefits PAWSS is a Vessel Traffic Service navigation information system that is based on commercial off-the-shelf products consisting of sensors, communications, and decision support equipment. PAWSS automates several processes for the Vessel Traffic Services Program and allows watchstanders to focus more on evaluating the traffic picture. PAWSS is deployed in a number of coastal locations throughout the U.S. and allows the Coast Guard to propagate important navigation information to mariners, thereby reducing collisions, groundings, and facilitates the safe and efficient transit of vessel traffic. The system compresses radar, VHF-FM voice, AIS, and video from remote sites into commercial leased landlines or microwaves and sends the information to a central VTS (Vessel Traffic Center). The vessel data is processed and displayed in a graphical interface, chart based format that leads itself to early recognition of potentially dangerous situations. A minimum of twelve months of vessel transit data is stored in an Oracle database for later reconstructing collisions, spills or other incidences. Additionally, the historical data facilitates data mining to analyze potential trends, such as, traffic density, port tonnage and fulfilling Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. PAWSS utilizes Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software and hardware. The core component of the PAWSS is based upon the proprietary Lockheed Martin MTM-200 Software Architecture.

Maritime Operational Threat Response benefits in achieving a coordinated U.S. Government response to threats to the US in the maritime domain.  NAIS will facilitate the Coast Guard response to threats in the maritime domain by enabling better visibility of suspect vessels as well as other vessels in the vicinity.  NAIS will allow for visibility and tracking of U.S. Government vessel assets for improved overall coordination of resources.  Maritime Communications benefits are associated with improved USCG ability to communicate with vessels in support of various USCG missions.  These benefits include the enhanced exchange of navigation information, improved communications interoperability with foreign vessels and other Government agencies' vessels, and backup capability to the Rescue 21 voice systems via AIS messaging.  The following USCG systems are dependent upon NAIS: IOC,  WebCOP, eGIS, MISLE, and MAGNet.","024-037 : Maritime Security Operations","For programmatic innovation, the NAIS Project/Sponsor supports OMB/DHS strategic goal which is the  recapitalization of the Increment 1 Receive only system in 50 of 58 ports with Increment 2 transceiver technology. To briefly describe how to accomplish this goal, the Increment  2 deployment strategy is as follows:*          - Deploy by Sector to build regional coverage (Gulf Coast, Mid Atlantic)*          - Build coverage adjacent to first 3 Sectors*          - Leverage R21 Infrastructure to minimize shore facility costs*          - Continue deployment to the 58 Ports*          - Close existing coastal coverage gaps in accordance with Sponsor priorities  For technology innovation, NAIS improved situational awareness when combined with a common Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), Nationwide AIS Transmit capability will enable advanced collision avoidance.  And, critical, timely information can be sent to specific vessels or broadcast to many vessels that include :-         Meteorological and Hydrological Information (e.g. weather, tides, currents)-         Notices to Mariners (NTM) (e.g. section of port closed for a time period)-         Urgent Marine Information Broadcast (UMIB)-         Marine Assistance Request Broadcast (MARB)-         Virtual Aids to Navigation (AtoN)By sharing a common view of the maritime environment, U.S. Government forces can collaborate more effectively communicate using secure, encrypted AIS messages, maintain a running record of events to automatically be analyzed for suspicious behavior based on a number of criteriaAfter the CG Enterprise Architecture Board (EAB) reviewed the NAIS project investment, we received a  EAB condition memo dated 19JAN11 from CG Office of Enterprise Architecture and Governance /CG-66 in order to be in alignment with the Coast Guard Enterprise Architecture Alignment (CGEA) and CPIC Control Phase.  After having met all EAB conditions, the NAIS ADE3/Enterprise AIS Data Services (EADS) obtained an email dated 4/26/2012 from CG-66 to acknowledge that NAIS ADE3/EADS  is in alignment with CGEA and the CPIC Control Phase and was granted authority to move forward.Joint Portfolio Review: Recommendation was to Keep/Modify.","NAIS improves maritime domain awareness and offers improvements in collision avoidance, maritime safety, environmental protection and national security through the detection, classification and tracking of vessels whether they are in national water or still thousands of miles off shore.  The ROI of 7.94, as calculated in the NAIS Alternatives Analysis of Dec 29, 2006, was calculated by determining the sum of the present value of all benefits and dividing it by the sum of the present value of all costs of each capability.  The benefits of security risk reduction (such as detection of large commercial vessel introduces WMD into US port and fishing vessel has a crew member onboard suspected of being a terrorist) are included in the ROI calculation.  The benefits of operational performance (such as improved Search and Rescue detection and response and collision detection and enforcement) have not been included because the confidence in those calculations was low; however if they were to be included, the ROI would be even higher.  The benefits were calculated for the following capabilities provided by NAIS: coastal receive, coastal transmit, long range receive, advanced data capability, and inland waters receive and transmit.  For each capability a variety of scenarios were evaluated using probabilities of occurrence and consequence costs to demonstrate the improvement in security risk by implementing NAIS.  The present value of all costs of each capability was calculated using the LCCE produced as part of the NAIS Alternatives Analysis document.  The total benefit was calculated as $5,704,345,592; the total LCC was calculated as $718,062,000; the ROI was calculated as 7.94.  While 7.94 is the ROI for the whole NAIS system, each Increment offers improvements in each capability to differing degrees.  Increment 1 primarily benefits coastal receive.  After recapitalization of Increment 1 with Increment 2, the return on investment is significant improvement of marine safety and security by increasing receive coverage from 24nm to 50 nm, the addition of transmit capability out to 24 nm, and advanced data capability.  Increment 3 primarily benefits long range receive.","During PY14, the project deployed additional sites as allowed by the DHS issued ADM in Feb13 and has completed deployment of 93 Permanent Transceive System (PTS) sites as of Feb14. The project also decommissioned 24 Initial Receive Capabilitiy (IRC) sties that the PTSs as of Jun14. The additional deployment has allowed the project to move forward in meeting the baseline requirement to transmit standard AIS messages. Operational Testing and Evaluation was completed in Oct13 with recommendation to continue deployment. DHS OT&E also issued the opinion that the project should continue with deployment. In order to address the program breach stated in Feb13 ADM, the project revised the LCCE and updated the APB to reflect the changes. Additional project documents, including the PMP, AAS, and DP, have been updated accordingly. These documents are in signature approval and expected to be fully approved by the end of the PY14.

This project addresses item three of the five parts that constitute an IOC. For each location to achieve IOC designation an agreement must be in place between relevant port partners for 1. regularly scheduled coordination meetings; 2. agencies to share awareness of maritime assets' operational schedules; 3. direct access to Watchkeeper; 4. joint awareness/coordination between CG and CBP of planned vessel inspections; and 5. unified command structure under which the IOC operates.  Goals:   * Collaborate with port partners for joint planning and operations through risk-based assignment of resources to mission demands; * Share targeting, intelligence and scheduling information to improve situational awareness, uncover gaps in planned and ongoing operations, and reduce duplication of effort between agencies; * Allow Coast Guard command centers to develop real-time awareness, evaluate threats and deploy finite resources to the right places through active collection of port activity information; and* Minimize the economic impact from any disruption, whether natural or manmade. Benefits: * Access to a geographic information tool that provides a common operating picture to achieve enhanced situational awareness* Shared awareness of the operational schedules of maritime assets in the port* A tool to present and share the products of regular coordination meetings with federal, state and local port partners, including awareness and coordination between USCG and CBP of planned vessel inspection activities. Mission Contribution:  A primary enabler of IOCs is the establishment of an information sharing and management system.

Joint Portfolio Review recommendation was to Proceed.  IOC is identified as a Congressional Legislative Mandate investment and is included in the DHS EA Transition Plan (recent version dated February 2011) and is part of the Domain Awareness Segment.   The Domain Awareness Portfolio includes activities and supporting IT capabilities to patrol and monitor areas of interest (e.g., land and sea borders, special events) for illegal or suspicious activities and to tactically deploy resources to monitor and respond to the areas of interest. Of the 11 Domain Awareness portfolio capabilities, IOC supports the following     * Gathering and analysis of all source intelligence information for the synthesis into a comprehensive integrated operating picture.   * Providing timely automated message handling and dissemination of data essential to risk recognition, evaluation, and application.   * Providing infrastructure tailored to the dissemination of critical risk and response data, supporting rapid correlation and timely responses.   * Sharing intelligence and information to provide previously uncorrelated information, in an effective risk discovery and response delivery process.   * Gathering and analyzing all source intelligence information, including imagery, human intelligence, and other types of intelligence.   * Integrating all sources of intelligence and threat data for multiple types of threats, e.g., terrorist threat data.   * Analyzing the threat to the nation as a whole from various types of threats.   * Providing a dedicated mission support facility and infrastructure to assure all-hours availability of intelligence and information at all points of need.   * Operating risk assessment infrastructure to integrate data and to disburse knowledge to points of action in support of the Homeland Security mission.

Each sector has, on average, 3 shifts of 3 WatchStanders. The use of the WatchKeeper system has reduced the need to log into several other systems, thus saving approximately 30 minutes of time per WatchStander per day. Therefore, current annual return on investment (ROI) from a purely manpower standpoint is 37 Sectors X 365 days X 3 shifts X 3 WatchStanders X  man hours saved per day = 60,772.50 man hours saved annually. These man hours can be spent on other IOC activities, further reducing staffing needs at each Sector while improving the effectiveness of the WatchStander. The use of the WatchKeeper system benefits other organizations by proving them with an integrated view and consolidation of multiple system interfaces into one system and eliminates the need for them to build and maintain similar systems providing WatchKeeper functions. Overall, while the investment is providing value to the users, the Program Office continues to explore cost effective alternatives and opportunities for convergence. The program is exploring system enhancements based on a planned migration to an open architecture and the development of IOC business-based widgets (Ozone Widget Framework standards) that will permit improved management of services and adaptation of functionality during the operations and maintenance phase.

There are approximately 2389 VLS users. During a normal business day, VLS has approximately 755 concurrent users, and approximately 14,000 logins per quarter. Per ALCOAST 620/05 the Coast Guard is transforming/aligning our business processes for logistics. Logistics will use a single set of business processes modeled after the Aviation BPM. Goals: Short term goals for VLS are focused on 2 objectives: (1) to ensure VLS can support the aforementioned single set of business processes, and (2) to ensure the sustainability of VLS from a technical standpoint until it is replaced by the Coast Guard Logistics Information Management System (CG-LIMS). VLS components are presently undergoing a technical refresh to support these goals. VLS consists of Fleet Logistics System (FLS), Configuration Management Plus (CMPlus), and Naval and Electronics Supply Support System (NESSS). FLS provides an integrated logistics system for configuration management, financial and procurement management, supply support, maintenance and supply data for over 240 cutters and over 1000 standard boats.  CMPlus feeds configuration, maintenance and supply data to FLS. FLS uses the data from CMPlus for decision-making to support logistics. FLS provides NESSS with historical and future supply data via the maintenance information captured in CMPlus and FLS. NESSS provides supply data for use by FLS. NESSS supports all supply activities needed for the naval and electronics program. NESSS supports the financial management system for the Coast Guard Yard. FLS feeds CMPlus with new updated configuration, maintenance and supply data. CMPlus and FLS enable field units to create and send MILSTRIP requisition transactions and generate obligation accounting data.  Stakeholders, customers, and other beneficiaries:   Includes CG Headquarters directorates and offices, Logistics Centers, C4IT Service Center and its asset lines, Naval Engineering/Electronic Support Units, Product Line Managers, Asset Materiel Managers, Coast Guard Yard, Asset Project Offices, Finance Center, Cutters and boats, other government activities, contractors, and vendors.","024-039 : Mission Support","VLS is a Component target solution and does not plan to transition to an established DHS target. Technical innovation is being achieved, to the extent possible with steady-state funding, through an update of architectural elements in the VLS suite such as FLS to bring the application in line with security requirements and enterprise goals and direction including the use of SOA/ESB technologies. The tech refresh will also support modular development of improved functionality through periodic system releases. A Cost Benefit Analysis was conducted as part of a business case written to support the technical refresh of VLS. The business case recommended reducing the number of applications in the VLS suite from four to two. The two target applications are (1) an application supporting wholesale supply operations (NESSS), and a new application (retaining the name FLS) which provides all the functionality of 3 legacy applications (ARMS, CMPlus, and FLS), but with new IT underpinnings that meet DHS and CG business and enterprise IT objectives. By 3Q 2015, this is exactly what VLS will have achieved. Further, the data cleanup necessary to migrate CG units from the legacy VLS components to the new refreshed VLS component contributes greatly to the quality of the data, better aligning it for the migration to CG-LIMS.  In all of these ways, VLS aligns with the both the Coast Guards business process objectives, and its Enterprise Architecture.","VLS remains in alignment with DHS and Coast Guard strategic plans by supporting the Coast Guard's strategy to move to a single logistics system (CG-LIMS) by the end of FY 2017. The tech refresh of VLS, currently in the implementation phase, will enable the VLS to support modernized business processes for the CG surface logistics community, while affording the opportunity to improve data quality in the transition. VLS continues to provide a suite of logistics tools for the surface community that is evolving to support modernized Coast Guard business processes, on a new IT foundation that supports modular development, and from a suite with only half the number of applications, which drives down indirect costs of the program. This, in turn, will better support the Coast Guard while VLS is operational, and also during the transition to CG-LIMS. Components of VLS have been in operation for almost 20 years.  Initial ROI for VLS was realized well before the 7 year mark.  The VLS tech refresh is expected to be completed by the end of 2nd Qtr FY15.  After the completion of the project and staffing is at final allocation, return on investment will be realized in 2.5 years. Savings will be realized in certification and accreditation (due to only two systems requiring C&A after the refresh. The refresh also eliminates dependency and licensing costs on an enterprise CG VPN solution, but the primary benefit of is the elimination of dependencies in VLS on an obsolete and unsupportable database and technologies. Additional benefits include a vastly improved ability to support Coast Guard modernized business processes, and the ability to do frequent small improvements in the future (modular development). Technical benefits of the refresh include: (1) Moving the application and relational database management system to a modern, supportable development platform based upon technologies commonly supported at Coast Guard Operations Systems Center (OSC) and included in the Technology Reference Model. (2) Use of OSC SOA/ESB capability to deliver data to and from current and envisioned application entities. This facilitates the ability to deliver functionality now and replace systems later without impacting delivered capabilities. Included in this concept is improved ease of providing visibility of data from these applications at an enterprise level across CG and with DHS.","In the previous year, training and deployment of a tech refreshed FLS to more than 500 Coast Guard units was completed, along with successful user acceptance testing for the tech refreshed CMPlus (now a component of FLS called Mobile Asset Manager (MAM)). This will reduce the number of major components of VLS from 3 to 2. FLS modernized its MILSTRIP data format to the DLMS standard being mandated by Defense Logistics Agency  transaction services.  NESSS rolled multiple enhancements to the production system to include an automated method to gather and provide data to GSA aiding in the annual certification of inventory completeness and accuracy.  NESSS also completed the addition of Treasury Accounting Symbols and Business Type Codes as now required by the Treasury.  Each of these enhancements were completed on-time and within budget.","In the current year, we will retire CMPlus, reducing the number of components in the VLS suite from 3 to 2.  Between the PY and CY, this will eliminate two separately reported systems (ARMS and CMPlus) from TA FISMA, and reducing the C&A footprint of VLS to only two applications: FLS and NESSS.  The refresh will include new capabilities in FLS to support functionality formerly provided by CMPlus. 1) Inventory Management - provide inventory management for shore side units that currently utilize CMplus for this functionality. 2) Shore Side Support - the ability for cutters to request shore side assistance from their respective product line who will manage and coordinate the appropriate service providers through FLS ensuring the best method and provider is engaged.. These projects will allow FLS Mobile Asset Manager (MAM) to become the tool to be used on mobile units only as it will be developed with limited connectivity in mind. All other units will utilize the FLS or NESSS proper. The tech refresh will change the development environment for FLS to a sustainable one. NESSS objectives for this CY include the improvement in management of Allowance Parts Lists, Issue & Receipt of materiel, and accelerated vendor payments. In the BY, NESSS will add the ability to leverage AIT equipment to increase process efficiency and improve asset visibility and accountability, and the ability to uniquely identify an inventory item [serialized/ Individual User Identification (IUID) tracking].   For the CY and extending into the BY FLS will improve compliance with DISA STIGS, implement single Sign-On and move the business logic from forms to prepare enhance supportability and support an upgrade of Oracle Forms.  All of these enhancements either improve existing functionality, supportability, or system security.  In the BY, FLS will move to a new Defense Logistics agency data standard, DLMS, from the current MILSTRIP standard.  This will both improve bi-directional communications between DLA and Coast Guard, and support AIT integration between the two agencies to improve in-transit visibility of shipments, and promote automated receipt of orders into CG inventory (with RFID and barcode scanning).","no","yes","yes","no","yes","no","yes","no","","no","0.000000","5.207000","5.207000","5.207000","1994","2017","There are no fundamental or substantive changes.","EVM is required under all vehicles.

The goal is to provide an affordable, standard, an approved network at the Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) level. The network will provide a means for mission critical data exchange between Coast Guard members, contractors, port partners and other federal/states agencies that work with the Coast Guard.  The network is a critical tool used by the Coast Guard to communicate and achieve success in Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship.   Benefits: Currently, CG One meets DHS mandates to use one network under DHS in order to improve management and security of the network.  The Coast Guard uses the network services provided by DHS under the Infrastructure Transformation Program (ITP) Working Capital Fund (WCF).  This solution allows the Coast Guard to meet requirements for department-wide information sharing and to consolidate its Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) networks into one department-wide network called OneNet; while sustaining the ability to connect with DOD computer networks (NIPRNET). The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency is responsible for DHS's OneNet network infrastructure under the ITP plan.  Mission Delivery/Support Functions:  CG One connects many platforms throughout the Coast Guard such as Standard Desktop Workstations, Enterprise Level Applications (e.g. MISLE, MAGNet, SANS) and remote facilities such as Rescue 21communication sites and NAIS vessel monitoring sites. It is also necessary for access to Cloud services.  Customers/Stakeholders:  CGOne, the Coast Guard portion of OneNet, serves every individual and contractor in the Coast Guard.  The stakeholders are DHS, DoD, CG CIO, CG operational units and support entities.  CGOne provides network transport services supporting every other IT investment (e.g. enterprise applications) obtained by the Coast Guard.","024-039 : Mission Support","The CG transition to CGONE supports the DHS Enterprise Architecture direction & enables compliance with mandates placed on DHS being part of the Infrastructure Transformation Program (ITP) enabling CG compliance in support of department-wide consolidation of the Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) networks into one department-wide network called OneNet.  The network infrastructure is controlled by The Customs and Border Proection (CBP) agency. The Coast Guard is required to order services from established contracts using standard published rates that have already been competed and authorized by contracting.  The Coast Guard CAN NOT change the contract mechanism but is being Innovation by best using available services of the contract to reduce operating cost (e.g. the types of servcies ordered to meet mission needs). Coast Guard engineering support and additional efficiencies will come from future enhancements of the network by the CPB; the Coast Guard will only provision such services as they are required.This program provides the infrastructure DHS and the Coast Guard needs to complete our missions.  CG One supports 'Safeguarding and Securing Cyberspace' by securing the Coast Guard network.  We use the latest anti-intrusion hardware and software.  We investigate, resolve and track all incidents.  We support 'Ensuring Resilience to Disasters' by providing the connectivity that all Contingency of Operations (COOP) plans need.","The CG One investment has been operational for over 15 years.  During that time, it has become an indispensible tool and has greatly improved efficiency throughout the Coast Guard.  Though it's very hard to quantitatively measure our ROI, the Network has been used to accomplish all the Coast Guard's 11 congressionally mandated missions.  The CG One provides essential support to most CG personnel and is used by most CG investments.The CGOne Investment runs on a cost recovery model.  When new personnel come into the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard may get funding to maintain the network.  If a Coast Guard unit purchases a new computer they must provide funds to support OneNet.   OneNet is integral to the success of the Coast Guard's missions.  CG One is used to do our Congressionally mandated Exhibit 300s.  Any other solution which provided the same connectivity would be more costly and/or less secure.","Routed internet traffic through the DOD IAPs to allow for advanced monitoring of the Coast Guard's .mil security enclave.  Added VSAT terminals to rescue 21 remote facilities to eliminate last mile outage issues.  Improve connectivity to CG cutters at sea by extending the network over fleet broadband and Ku SATCOM systems.","CGOne is currently in the Operations, Maintenance and Support phase. Areas of focus to sustain operations for CY & BY out years include: (1) replacing end-of-life network equipment (e.g. routers, switches), (2) monitoring network bandwidth utilization and making appropriate targeted circuit adjustments to optimize performance, (3) Comply with DHS, CG, & CG Cyber guidelines, directive and policies to maintain a resilient network against cyber threats.","yes","no","no","no","no","no","no","yes","","no","0.000000","24.191000","24.191000","24.191000","2009","2025","No significant changes.","These are DHS contracts.

It is the authoritative source for all USCG HR and personnel management data.  It is a cost efficient and effective investment that meets business owner expectations and is in alignment with USCG/DHS and USPHS/HHS mission and vision.   Provides HR and payroll services to two non-DoD uniformed services - NOAA CC and USPHS CC.  All three services follow HR and payroll requirements as mandated by the annual National Defense Authorization act and Direct Access fulfills those requirements for the three services  Goals:  Maintain state of the art HR and Payroll applications that are reliable, sustainable and secure; meet the business & mission requirements; sustain HR and payroll functions; and provide cost-effective, dependable, and accurate HR and payroll data used by CG and PHS for mission execution planning  Benefits:  Consolidated 5 CG HR and payroll applications and 6 PHS HR applications. It includes the legacy JUMPS payroll system, in process of being decommissioned. USPHS will gain new functions that will help it manage its workforce and improve accountability and efficiency in support of its missions.   On 4/1/08 the USCG Retiree and Annuitant payroll processing system was formally migrated from a legacy, custom built, mainframe based system, into the Direct Access application. In 4QFY07, USPHS CC was directed by OMB to investigate the USCG's success in implementing a commercial HR and Payroll product.   This demonstrates that the USCG is a Center of Excellence as a provider of outsourced Military HR services.   The Corps anticipates significant cost savings once it completes the migration. In compliance with Clinger-Cohen, FFMIA and FMFIA, and the guidance to maximize the use of COTS and Agile development.    Contribution to Mission: This investment is required to meet personnel tracking and military payroll requirements documented in Titles 10 and 14 of the US Code.  It enables real time data for ready deployment of USCG and USPHS personnel in response to planned and unplanned mission events. Direct Access provides a tool that captures officer skill sets and position requirements in an integrated, standardized way, allowing hiring officials and deployment staff to match officers with the attributes needed to the role at hand.  Key Stakeholders: USCG and USPHS active duty & retiree personnel, USCG & USPHS managers, and payroll processing, finance, & HR personnel.","024-039 : Mission Support","Direct Access was included in the DHS Joint Portfolio Review in 2QFY2013; no specific recommendations were made for this investment.  It is also included within the DHS EA Roadmap (recent version dated May 2013) and is part of the Enterprise Business Services Portfolio Human Capital Segment.  The Enterprise Services Portfolio includes activities and supporting IT capabilities for common or shared business services, including the foundational mechanisms and back office services used to achieve the purpose of the agency, such as financial accounting, human resource management, and logistics. Direct Access supports the following portfolio capabilities defined for this portfolio in the DHS EA Roadmap:     * Enabling common business processes across the DHS Enterprise for more efficient, management of the human resources, financial management, budgeting, asset management, training, procurement, security/clearance management, and records management functions.   * Providing management and self-management of employee benefits including medical and retirement benefits   * Managing employee time and attendance and payroll (excluding disbursement of funds to employees)   * Training employees and maintaining employee training records   * Maintaining employee personnel records   * Creating and approving an employee performance plan, for monitoring employee performance in accordance with that plan   * Identifying vacancies, developing and posting a job description for the vacancy, receiving and evaluating applications, and hiring an individual to fill the vacancy.    Joint Portfolio Review: Recommendation was to Proceed.   Direct Access aligns to QHSR Mission 5: Ensuring Resilience to Disasters Goal: 5.3: Ensure Effective Emergency Response by providing  a tool that captures officer skill sets and position requirements in an integrated, standardized way, allowing hiring officials and deployment staff to match officers with the attributes needed to the role at hand in support of multiple missions.  It is the authoritative source for all USCG HR and personnel management data.  It is a cost efficient and effective investment providing an application / service platform that meets business owner expectations and is in alignment with DHS / USCG, HHS / USPHS, and NOAA missions and visions.","Direct Access consolidated 5 CG HR and payroll applications and 6 PHS HR applications. It is a cost effective O&M IT investment that meets and exceeds business owner expectations. As evidenced by the data below, the Direct Access investment continues to be a good idea. External benefits have increased with this consolidation in that users can access multiple payroll applications in one place. Another example is by automating absence request processing, the Coast Guard has saved approximately 13,500 man-hours of data entry work for field HR personnel (~6.6 FTE) which translates to $548,166 dollars a year for just this one transaction. As we extend this solution to other transactions, the cost savings will increase. The time savings enables CG members to devote time to other organizational work. Direct Access also resulted in the elimination of 115 Yeoman billets in 2000, which resulted in a $12M annual recurring dollar savings. This savings is recurring every year since.    In addition, for each system that gets transitioned into Direct Access, there is a ~$600,000 annual cost savings in terms of hardware, software, and administration support. For each retired system, there is approximately $75,000 in annual savings associated with security continuous monitoring, annual security self-assessments, and annual contingency Plan testing. There is also a $75,000 - $100,000 cost savings every three years associated with the elimination of security authorization for these systems. These savings allow Coast Guard to focus on improving the security of other systems in the inventory.   The ROI is calculated by the savings from Yeoman billets ($12M) plus the savings from automating absence request processing ($0.548M) plus the FY13 savings from systems transitioned into Direct Access (Orders and Accessions) and decommissioning of RATS ($1.200M) divided by FY13 costs ($10.270M).","Current Year 2014 accomplishments include:* Implemented USPHS Retiree Pay* Completed design and system testing for the following:- Career Management- Separations- Reserve Activities- Orders- SPO-PCSCompleted User Validation Test of Tech Refresh functions went live 1/1/2014.","FY2015 Milestones  include: *  FY15 Q1: Complete Reserve Activities technology refresh module - complete*  FY15 Q1: Complete Separations technology refresh module  - complete*  FY15 Q1: Complete Career Management technology refresh module - complete*  FY15 Q1: Complete Orders/SPO-PCS technology refresh module  - complete*  FY15 Q1: Go live for Direct Access 9.1 and Global Payroll and HR - complete*  FY15 Q2: Complete Active Duty Payroll technology refresh module *  FY15 Q3: Complete Employee Reviews technology refresh module *  FY15 Q3: Complete Training Administration technology refresh module *  FY15 Q3: Complete Disciplinary Actions technology refresh module.Budget Year 2016 milestones include:*  FY16 Q2: Complete PHS AD Payroll technology refresh module*  FY16 Q2: Complete PHS AD Orders technology refresh module*  FY16 Q2: Complete PHS AD Separations technology refresh module*  FY16 Q2: Complete PHS AD Contracts technology refresh module.","yes","no","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","no","","no","15.846000","13.901000","13.901000","13.306000","1992","2018","The summary of funding has not increased.","Labor Hour contracts only require a labor deliverable, and when these contracts were first established several years ago, and due to the nature of the required work and the evolving DHS and USCG operational environments, it was not possible to accurately estimate the scope and associated costs for many of the anticipated tasks.

All financial transactions are consolidated in the CAS suite so that information can be reported to the Department of Homeland Security.  Goal: The goal of the CAS suite is to process financial data and generate reports and statements to meet federal requirements.  The CAS suite includes: Oracle Federal Financials (OFF) (a commercial off-the-shelf, product that includes - accounts receivable, assets, projects, inventory, accounts payable, purchasing, and general ledger), Sunflower (property management system used by the Transportation Security Agency), Finance and Procurement Desktop (FPD) (enterprise-wide accounting and procurement system assigned to assist in funds and procurement management), Workflow Imaging Network System (WINS) (imaging and document processing system), and Contract Information Management System (CIMS) (contract management). Benefit: The benefits of the CAS suite involves the analytical evaluation of projects and programs quantitatively, which improves project and program efficiencies and effectiveness; integrating all aspects of accounting and budget requirements for projects and programs.  The CAS suite tracks the financial cost of purchases, delivers, payments, and expenditures, making data management more efficient and report inquire readily available to users and managers.Investment: The investment in the CAS suite supports all the critical operational activities of three major components within the Department of Homeland Security by recording and accounting for transactions.  Moreover, the CAS suite serves as an enterprise accounting, procurement, assets and management decision support system.Support Function:  The CAS suite supports the DHS missions and all USCG missions by providing the capability to procure goods and services that directly support the missions.Key customers, stakeholder, and other beneficiaries: The agency management support function of the CAS suite is to services over 2,400 commands and field units throughout the U.S. Coast Guard, Transportation Security Agency, and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.  The CAS suite monitors the scope of activities to be covered by accounting and financial systems.","024-039 : Mission Support","Enterprise Architect: The U.S. Coast Guard has developed strategies to replace the current Core Accounting System (CAS) suite with Federal Shared Service Provider (FSSP) via an interagency agreement with the Department of the Interior (DOI). Through a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, which is Oracle based financial management software, the Coast Guard will achieve compliance with the DHS mandated Financial System Modernization (FMS). The Coast Guard's Financial Management Service Improvement Initiative (FMSII), will be better able to meet the DHS leadership's needs for holistic, enterprise-level view of how resources are allocated and spent. In addition, enterprise architecture enhancements will be aligned with the Department of Homeland Security's compliance and security requirements. Enterprise Roadmap: The future state of FMSII entails implementing, and facilitating sound, innovative integrated enterprise architecture in accordance with the DHS Enterprise Roadmap. One of FMSII's key focuses is on promoting an effective and efficient design and operation of all major resources management processes. Furthermore, a comprehensive approach to information technology is central and of the utmost importance. The objective is to implements industry best practices to improve performance and lower cost. Innovation: The CAS suite utilizes an out dated and labor intensive set of modules that are unstable and will no longer be supported. With FMSII, a new, state-of-the-art product will be used by the Coast Guard that supports the Department of Homeland Security's enterprise architecture roadmap. Amongst the benefits of the new financial management system are an improvement to the enterprise view of resources, provide timely information in the support of critical decisions and reduce costly support and maintenance."," Return on Investment: The U.S. Coast Guard's information technology strategic plan supports the mission and drives investment decisions guiding the goals and priorities..  Future enhancement will be implemented to sustain the Core Accounting System (CAS) suite to maintain the system while seeking measures for future investment strategies. The strategic plan will be aligned with federal requirements and departmental guidance.  The current CAS suite is in a support state and a return on investment was not calculated since no additional investment is planned. Benefits Internal (Government): A benefit of the CAS suite is that the system supports  accounting, asset management, and procurement system for the U.S. Coast Guard, Transportation Security Agency, and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.  All financial transactions are consolidated in the CAS suite so that information can be reported to the Department of Homeland Security in a timely manner. The CAS suite records and tracks accounting and financial activities, ensuring that legislative, Government Accounting Office, Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Homeland Security requirements are captured. Benefits External (General Public):  The external benefits stems on continued service to the general public regarding support from the U.S. Coast Guard, Transportation Security Agency, and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office.  These Department of Homeland Security components support the nation by sustaining a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks, as well as emergency response during national catastrophe.  These components support the executive branch's efforts of comprehensive homeland security.","In 2014, the CAS suite was updated to support the Department of Treasury TAS/BETC - TPMA requirements which was critical to TSA, DNDO, and the USCG's ability to meet the DHS and Treasury deadlines for reporting our financial data.  This effort took 9 months and was completed on-time.   System performance has met or exceeded requirements each month.

Major CG stakeholders include the Mission Support, Operations, Resource, and Command Control staffs, Senior Leadership Council, and field units, CG Auxiliary and DoD.CGBI has used the ROI Methodology to determine value. Using only a limited set of value structures (primarily, a metric of time savings for users against the full risk and cost structures netted a 160% ROI.","000-000 : (Primary Program Not Available)","CGBI's Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), reporting functionality, and  Business Intelligence (BI) capabilities provide several key capabilities towards the USCG EA. The EDW is the Master Data (most shared data) repository for the USCG and is a key element in developing the USCG's FEA DRM. The Master data in the EDW from over 40 systems provides consolidated performance and operational reporting across all lines of business, greatly reducing reporting costs. BI functionality consolidates reporting, dashboards, alerts, scorecards and data visualization and discovery tools within the system serving all functional areas of the Coast Guard. As the enterprise Roadmap seeks greater collaboration and consolidation, the CGBI system has demonstrated itself as a key capability in reducing or eliminating the need for additional IT systems through data reuse and dissemination. The CGBI system has a conservative ROI of 160% based on time savings (cost reduction) alone. Factoring in improved outcomes (organizational performance) and Improved Readiness status across the USCG's $9.6B investment, external cost avoidances and ancillary returns, the CGBI system has a ROI potential as high as $1B.Architectural changes include review of current mega-vendor software suite versions for replacement rather than upgrade. For example, the current integrated Business Intelligence software suite included a module for dashboards, however the total cost of ownership to implement this one capability fully exceeded the available operational funding by a wide margin, as it required additional database analysts and developers, additional software plug-in modules and hardware. It was also not self-service from the customer perspective. Instead of fully implementing the next software version from the current vendor, it was found through the analysis of alternatives that a niche application was more appropriate. The niche application does only dashboarding but better and cheaper than the module supplied with the suite vendor. As dashboards are a key component of USCG performance management processes across all functional areas this will drive down overall operational costs of the system while increasing performance and efficiency by making dashboard prototyping self service instead of a IT developer function.

Beneficiaries of the CG-LIMS project are the U.S. Coast Guard, DHS, and DoD.","024-039 : Mission Support","CG-LIMS follows the DHS Enterprise Roadmap.  CG-LIMS is included within the Enterprise Business Services portfolio.  This portfolio includes activities and supporting IT capabilities for common or shared business services, including the foundational mechanisms and back office services used to achieve the purpose of the agency, such as financial accounting, human resource management, and logistics.  CG-LIMS supports the portfolio capability, which is purchasing and managing assets, services, and contracts in conjunction with these assets and services.

Replacing many existing, resource-intensive logistics systems with one centrally-managed, integrated system provides the additional immediate potential benefit of significant cost savings in the IT application alone.   The ability to fully trace financial obligations, asset valuations, and overall CFO Act and FFMIA compliance is a high priority for the Coast Guard. An integrated, centrally-managed logistics system, properly integrated with the Core Accounting System at the transaction level of detail, will enable accountable tracking of financial transactions throughout the organization, in lieu of the current stove-piped processes that make the task manpower-intensive and overwhelming.   Current legacy logistics IT investments in the Coast Guard will be targeted for consolidation and replacement by CG-LIMS. Capability required for each stove-piped community will be fully considered in the requirements phase of this investment.    The Coast Guard's financial transformation and progress toward compliance with CFO Act and FFMIA is enhanced by the transparency of logistics systems and ability to interface with relevant information managed within them. Investing in a centrally-managed, integrated logistics system will enable the Coast Guard to provide timely and consistent data to the Coast Guard's Core Accounting System.   Tightly integrating business processes and systems with mission needs, made possible in part by organizational changes, will significantly reduce costs and improve the effectiveness of logistics operations throughout the lifecycle of assets, including disposal. Appropriate stakeholders, such as financial, property, workforce, operations, systems engineering, and information architecture representatives will be involved with identifying needed capability of CG-LIMS and ensuring integration requirements are captured. DHS has described the Asset Management portfolio as including all activities related to the maintenance, administration and operation of office buildings, fleets, machinery and other capital assets that are possessions of the federal government. The Coast Guard has identified this portfolio as the correct one for all our logistics management and supply chain related systems, to include CG-LIMS.","The COTS software was purchased and industry subject matter experts of the COTS software were contracted to support the US Coast Guard System Development Agent. The development environments were established and security controls applied to both the operating system and the application. The development team completed multiple releases using an Agile Scrum methodology. The third release of CG-LIMS delivering usable functionally was completed, and the release was delivered as a pilot to the HC144 product line.","Based on approved funding levels, the following are the planned accomplishments for CG-LIMS.    CY 2015:  Implement Configuration Management and Unit Level Maintenance Management functionality to the 144A fleet.Configure Depot Maintenance Management functionality.  Configure Supply Chain Management functionality.Configure Technical Information Management functionality.     BY 2016Implement CG-LIMS functionality to the field.  Segment 1 will implement configuration management and maintenance management functionality. Because CG-LIMS will replace the Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) as the preferred tool to manage transformed assets in accordance with the modernized mission support business model, ALMIS assets will be targeted first for migration to CG-LIMS. The functional requirements for Segment 1 eclipse the functional capability provided by the Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) subsystem of ALMIS.  Consequently, once Segment 1 is implemented and all assets previously enrolled in ACMS are migrated to CGLIMS, ACMS can be retired. Remaining assets will be migrated to CG-LIMS according to the logistics transformation schedule. Segment 1 is scheduled to take 6 releases  and 6 pilots to complete. At the end of pilot 3, CG-LIMS will have delivered the functionality required to begin migration of assets from legacy systems into CG-LIMS.  At this point, a Phase Exit Review will be conducted and CG-LIMS will declare IOC.    Segment 2 will implement supply chain management functionality, replacing the Asset Maintenance Management Information System (AMMIS) subsystem of ALMIS once migration is complete.  Segment 2 is scheduled to take 4 releases and 4 pilots to complete.   Segment 3 will implement technical information management functionality, providing a single repository for electronic technical documentation which is retrievable, viewable, and printable from the CG-LIMS application. Changes to technical documentation will also be managed and promulgated from within the system.

In lieu of EVM, the CG-LIMS project team reviews monthly status reports to verify that work accomplished is consistent work reported in the status report.  Regardless of contract type, size or duration, the CG-LIMS COTR and PM meet regularly with the contractual PMs to verify that work is being met within contractually established cost, schedule, and performance metrics.           In addition to external contractors, CG-LIMS will leverage other 'in house' offices such as ALC, OSC, etc. to provide services to the CG-LIMS project.  These intra-agency agreements include specific cost, schedule, and performance metrics similar to CG-LIMS contracts with external entities.  The CG-LIMS PM meets regularly with the USCG assigned PMs to verify that metrics are being met.               In both instances (external contractors and intra-agency entities) if metrics are not being met, remediation plans are formulated and implemented. Regular reviews of the CG-LIMS risk matrix assists to identify potential issues before they occur and implement remediation plans in a proactive manner.","3","The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Logistics Information Management System (CG-LIMS) is in the Mixed life cycle phase. Since the last assessment, the CG-LIMS program is making steady progress and delivering valuable capability to the users while supporting the Coast Guard HC-144A aircraft for daily maintenance and configuration managment. The cost variance is within OMB acceptable range. However, the program is still addressing schedule delays associated with software discrepancies identified during Release 3 user acceptance. After extensive collaboration with Oracle developers, a software patch was delivered in early 2014, and the CG-LIMS software instance was re-configured, tested, piloted and promoted to the CG-LIMS production environment in October 2014. A revised program plan was approved by CG CIO and reflects the current cost estimate, schedule baseline and performance parameters.CG-LIMS Initial Operating Capability was achieved December 2014 and an Operational Analysis will be conducted within twelve months to accurately assess how the system is operating in a real-world environment. The program has validated that the software can manage complex configurations and maintenance activities with exceptional accuracy. The initial Operational Analysis is planned after implementation of CG-LIMS Release 6 during the 2QFY16.

C4ISR mission needs, threats and gaps described in the 2004 Deepwater Mission Need Statement (MNS) were validated in a 2009 C4ISR MNS and remain valid. C4ISR concerns extend beyond deepwater regions to wherever Coast Guard assets are relied upon to support the service's enduring roles of Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship. Without a modernized C4ISR suite, our adversaries are free to navigate our expansive maritime region with increasing impunity. To effectively respond, the C4ISR modernization project will focus on the following priorities: Functionality: Obtain core C4ISR for air, surface, intelligence and shore; Interoperability: Transition from proprietary to government to open solutions; Implementation: Net-centric design, initial asset installs and upgrades and back-fits; Supportability: Lab infrastructure that supports the Government's role as system integrator and keeps pace with constantly evolving information technology demands and standard changes; Sustainment: Technology development and upgrades that reduce O&M costs.Stakeholders include DHS, DoD, CG operators, Sponsor (CG-7), and Technical Authority (CG-6).The project is currently delivering C4ISR capability to the NSC class and LRS/MRS assets. The project has begun coordination and tailoring of the SEAWATCH design for OPC C4ISR. The project also supports newly-acquired assets with C4ISR IA/TEMPEST/C&A/IV&V efforts. Additionally the project will provide in-service cutter upgrades. This system has and will continue providing operational commanders, ship Commanding Officers, aircraft commanders, and operational planners, the tools, intelligence, and common operating picture necessary to survey, detect, classify, identify, and prosecute intended targets.","024-032 : Cross-Cutting Capital Investments","1.  The Enterprise Roadmap is currently called the DHS Enterprise Transition Strategy and USCG C4ISR is contained as a contributor in this document under the Domain Awareness Portfolio.  Specifically, it cites: SBU GSS HC-130J Type SBU GSS HC-144A TypeSBU GSS NSC Type In addition, the C4ISR program is contributing to the DHS Target Architecture by leveraging the following target solutions: Active Directory and Kerberos:Most IT Services are provided through the IT infrastructure and CGOne. The Coast Guard enterprise implementation of such solutions is not borne by the C4ISR Modernization acquisition.   MD4300:The C4ISR system will undergo a C&A prior to deployment on all surface and air assets following MD4300 and applicable appendices. eAuth:All users will have to authenticate prior to accessing the C4ISR system.  Ideally this will be accomplished via a single sign on process for DHS personnel. The Common Access Cards (CAC) have embedded Verisign PKI certificates which are used for authentication and identification 2.  The C4ISR Program has a technology obsolescence plan that specifies how systems and technology are monitored and how the program uses technology solutions and standards, from a performance, state of the market, and from a DHS technical reference model perspective.  Generally, the C4ISR program budget has limited funding for research, discovery and invention, trade and innovation studies.  Trade space investigation and analysis of alternatives are ongoing for the purposes of capability tradeoffs and requirements gap fulfillment. Innovations of the project include the ability for select Coast Guard units to participate in the global command and control network providing enhanced situational awareness and cutting edge technology.Joint Portfolio Review: Recommendation was to Proceed.","For each class of Coast Guard assets, the C4ISR project designs and develops the software and hardware systems that enable the Coast Guard to collect operational and intelligence data; process and integrate that data into operationally valued and assured information; and analyze, evaluate, and/or interpret the available operational and intelligence information into actionable knowledge. An asset equipped with modern C4ISR equipment will be able to synthesize its own sensor data with data from other sources, such as Coast Guard and partner agency ships, aircraft, and shore commands. This functionality allows Coast Guard units to see, hear, and process what all other friendly assets see, hear, and process, facilitating tactical decisions for operational commanders - both on-scene and from afar. This enhances situational awareness within maritime areas of the United States, specifically focusing on the mitigation of possible threats from terrorists and other criminals, while concurrently observing and assisting legitimate users in American ports, waterways, and coastal regions.The return on investment for C4ISR Segment 2 is represented by numerous qualitative enhancements over the Segment 1 system that will aid the Coast Guard in meeting mission needs. Segment 2 is designed to meet the critical interoperability requirements for exchanging information with mission partners (DOD, DHS, OGAs, state, local, and/or foreign governments) as defined within the top-level Information Exchange Requirements satisfying critical missions, compliant with Coast Guard IT Products and Standards Profile, DHS ONE NET specifications, and the principles and rules identified in the Coast Guard Information Technology Management Strategy. Other user efficiencies that are provided by Segment 2 include a fully capable transmit/receive Link-11 solution; the creation of the real-time tactical domain, with redundancy and failover capability; IFF tracker integration; conversion from Network Attached Storage to a hybrid Storage Attached Network for increased capacity and reliability; a Central Control System to execute admin functions from any console; and network management and system monitoring upgrades.","FY14: - Installed Segment 2 (S2) Tech Demonstrator software update on NSC 2- Awarded contract for producing next 2 S2 shipsets for retrofit- Completed KU Band SATCOM installation on in-service cutters- Demonstrated transmit (CG first) & receive Link-11 operations on NSC S2- Worked closely with Navy and CG partners to generate GFI deliverables for Phase 1 of OPC acquisition process - With C3CEN, completed OPC-Seawatch Technical Data Package- With OPC project, established partnership with Navy for NTNO systems on the OPC- Obtained C-LAN ATO for FRC 8- Finished development of $4.6M DMS effort supporting delivery of HC130J MSS 7-8 and HC144A MSP 13-17, with aviation software v5.3- Installed Symphony upgrade to NSC 3's ACRM system- Installed Seawatch-270 onboard 7 CGC cutters- Completed classified laptop software integration and testing- Procured and installed the Universal Hand Control Unit onboard 6 LRS aircraft- Received DHS approval of updated APB v2.0.","The project will continue to deliver C4ISR capability to the National Security Cutters (NSCs), and Long Range Surveillance/Medium Range Surveillance (LRS/MRS) aircrafts.

ALMIS is a centralized system that captures programmatic information that is used at all levels of the Coast Guard. The goal is to align ourselves with the Commandant's direction to protect those on the sea and protect the nation from threats delivered by the sea and protect the sea itself by providing mission ready crews and assets and to support ALMIS users with system availability of 98% or better.   ALMIS benefits our 22,000 customers and stakeholders by providing an electronic system which is reliable, ensures safe and mission ready assets, captures mission events accurately, is user friendly, and provides total asset status visibility.  ALMIS provides operational oversight capability for mission scheduling and execution. ALMIS benefits operational leadership by providing the tools to maintain OPCON/TACON oversight of our missions and assets. ALMIS directly supports our aviation and naval units to include 325 aircraft, 1,618 Small Boats, 166 Cutters and 109 DGPS Towers. ALMIS benefits also include the metrics and statistics to support HQ operational budgetary requirements. ALMIS contributes to Coast Guard mission delivery by supporting data entry from the start of an operational mission, recording the mission execution and tracking crew competencies and proficiency. The system maintains aircraft and naval asset maintenance along with standardization, supply, part replacements, and warehouse activities in order to provide safe and mission ready assets.  ALMIS supports core financial procurement actions, and the reconciliation necessary for current business processes. ALMIS contributes to the four key components of the circle of logistics, which are: mission, configuration, maintenance, and supply. The key customers of ALMIS are the Configuration Control Board (CCB) membership representing the logistics centers, operational leadership and those providing the actual asset logistics support. Our major stakeholders include CG-4, CG-7 and C4IT-SC along with the logistics centers to include SFLC, SILC and ALC.Our country is a beneficiary as evidenced last year when the Coast Guard prosecuted 20,452 SAR cases resulting in many lives saved.","024-039 : Mission Support","The Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) Segmented Architecture (SA) contributes to the agency target EA by aligning directly with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Enterprise Business Services to manage finances, procurements and acquisitions, information systems and technology, human resources, operational resources, facilities, project management, and other administrative services. ALMIS achieves programmatic innovation by providing efficient, flexible, and cost-effective asset operations, logistics, and maintenance support to aviation and naval units.  The objective is to link strategy, programs, and budgets systematically to result in a strategy-driven organization. Although this is being accomplished, it is not done with ease. CG Logistics Information Management System (CG-LIMS) was chosen to succeed ALMIS by 2021. This will achieve programmatic and technical innovation.  CG-LIMS will add lower level processes that can be implemented more efficiently with modern, integrated IT tools. Ultimately, it will consolidate CG disparate logistics systems into a common suite of IT tools used by all C4ISR systems, cutters, aircraft, and shore facilities to support common processes. This consolidation will eliminate redundant data entry and manual interface processes. CG-LIMS will be able to link configuration, maintenance, supply chain, and technical information management more efficiently. It will also provide total asset visibility and increase operational readiness and effectiveness while decreasing costs. ALMIS provides and captures a wealth of information to make sound decisions for 1. Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security, 2. Securing and Managing Our Borders, 3. Enforcing and Administering Our Immigration Laws, 4. Safeguarding and Securing Cyberspace, and 5. Ensuring Resilience to Disasters. ALMIS provides detailed mission operational data as well as a full scope of logistics information for decision-makers for ensuring shared awareness of risks and threats, building capable communities, creating unity of effort, and enhancing the use of science and technology underpin our national efforts to prevent terrorism and enhance security, secure and manage our borders, enforce and administer our immigration laws, safeguard and secure cyberspace, and ensure resilience to disasters.  We also have a fully functioning Disaster Recovery site. Joint Portfolio Review - recommendation to Keep/Modify.","The Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) directly integrates with aviation and naval core business processes for operations, configuration, maintenance, and supply which directly aligns and supports the three roles of the Coast Guard; Protect those on the sea; Protect the U.S. from threats delivered by sea; and Protect the sea itself.   Return on Investment is a performance measure which evaluates the gain from investment divided by the cost.  In our organization this return on investment is measured by meeting the key goals and missions of the Coast Guard which ALMIS directly supports.   The benefits from aviation are reflected in the following highlights:  The Coast Guard responded to over 38,000 potential cases, benefiting the public by saving more than 3,200 lives in FY13.  Additionally there were over 6,000 sorties supporting Living Marine Resources, 3,300 sorties for Drug Interdiction and 1,900 Migrant Interdiction sorties that directly benefit all citizens. Coast Guard aviations' 325 aircraft and their crews played a significant part in these accomplishments.  ALC's unwavering air station support ensured the operational unit readiness, measured by operational availability met the needs of the public.  The benefit of Coast Guard mission success is the result of key operational/engineering support and documentation systems which ALMIS provides.  ALMIS is the foundation for mission scheduling, asset permission and servicing, mission records, documentation of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, asset configuration, maintenance due lists to maintain all operational assets, key financial and supply support systems which when combined, keep our asset availability rate so high.   ALC continues to add both vessels and aircraft into ALMIS and is becoming the asset status system of record for most of the Coast Guard.  In 2013, ALC added the large cutters into ALMIS, achieving total asset visibility. This benefited the SFLC by increasing visibility over fleet maintenance.  SFLC has enrolled 166 cutters into ALMIS.  ALMIS also benefits the surface fleet by providing reports for the status of over 1,618 small boats. By this time next year, we expect the availability and maintenance status of 80% of the cutter fleet will be visible to Operational Commanders and Mission Support units via ALMIS. This is a huge benefit to SFLC as now ALMIS now tracks Operational Availability for the majority of their surface assets.","During PY14, there have been seven releases into ALMIS production. These releases are all documented via Project ID 14 through 20. These releases included routine software refreshes to include CFO compliance updates, EAL software refresh, and EAL modifications in support of the 3710.1G Flight manual update. These routine releases have also included hundreds of security patch upgrades to the ALMIS Operating Systems (Linux, HP Unix, and Windows).We have continued to induct additional surface assets and users into ALMIS.

The upcoming objectives for ALMIS will be to continue to provide the benefits listed earlier in this section. ALMIS will be able to continue to provide these benefits by providing the continuation of CFO compliance, supporting the replacement of Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) (which is a subsystem of ALMIS), EAL software refresh, and security patch implementations. The AMMIS subsystem of ALMIS (financial/supply) is in the full process of being replaced by CG-LIMS. All of these initiatives will be implemented during the routine maintenance schedule for ALMIS and are documented on the Projects and Activities table tab.CFO compliance updates will be promoted during the ALMIS Release 3.4.x scheduled for September 13, 2014 (Project ID 22). For ALMIS release 3.5.x scheduled for September 19, 2015, CFO updates will be promoted into ALMIS (Project ID 31). For ALMIS release 3.6.x scheduled for September 17, 2016, CFO updates will be promoted into ALMIS (Project ID 40). These CFO Compliance objectives support the ALMIS provided benefit of providing key financial and supply support systems to the Coast Guard.The ACMS replacement by CG-LIMS will continue through the CY and BY. Although the ACMS replacement is a major effort by CG-LIMS, at this point it does not require any modifications to ALMIS. As such, there are no references to CG-LIMS in our Project table. These activities should be included in the CG-LIMS projects and activities table.The EAL software refresh will continue through the BY. It will continue to be phased in during the regularly scheduled ALMIS releases. This objective supports the ALMIS provided benefit by providing the Coast Guard with an operational/engineering support and documentation system. The ALMIS database software (Ingres) will be refreshed from version 9 to version 10.ALMIS will continue to induct additional naval assets (additional cutters and small boats) into its system through the CY and BY.

These capabilities have been leveraged and integrated to expand the capabilities to inbound pedestrian, outbound vehicle and pedestrian, and Border Patrol (BP) checkpoint processing; and improve existing primary processing operations.  LBI's goals are to facilitate the flow of travelers into the U.S. in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to Secure and Manage Flows of People and Goods while minimizing disruption and facilitating safe and secure inbound and outbound legal flows of people and goods; increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of land border processing; and integrate data to support intelligence and targeting within the Land Border Triangle: inbound, checkpoint, and outbound.  Benefits include: vehicle (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without LBI technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes; reduced manual plate corrections and fewer time and labor intensive secondary referrals. The reduced number of acceptable documents, and increased document security features make it easier for officers to identify fraudulent documents.  LBI extended benefits from initial inbound vehicle capabilities by ensuring that vehicle and document data can also be acquired when vehicles leave the U.S. (outbound) or travel within the U.S. interior (Border Patrol checkpoints).  LBI has also extended these benefits to travelers entering the U.S. on foot (pedestrians) and buses.  Key LBI customers include CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and the traveling public.  LBI stakeholders include CBP officers and agents, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State.  The beneficiaries are the traveling public and the governments of Canada, and Mexico and their citizens.  The original LBI (formerly WHTI) investment allowed CBP to address the requirements imposed by Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), Public Law 108-458), as amended, by June 1, 2009.  LBI capabilities add security and decrease inbound primary processing time, which reduces border wait time.","024-044 : Securing and Expediting Travel","LBI aligns to CBP's Enterprise Technical Architecture 2.0 (ETA 2.0), the agency's target Enterprise Architecture (EA) framework.  The Program uses the EA principle of architecting, designing and planning, and implementation to ensure the applications will work on the ETA 2.0 Common Delivery Platform (CDP), a vendor agnostic, standard based architecture and the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).  Using the ETA 2.0 framework will also ensure LBI business capabilities will conform to the agency's technology and security architecture, DHS Information Technology (IT) Strategic Goals and be compliant with the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) 25 Point Program. LBI contributes to the QSR mission #2-Secure and management our borders, as well as the DHS Screening Portfolio.    LBI will architect and transition the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to the Identity, Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) security architecture when the agency's ICAM best practice and guidelines are released.  This ensures LBI will maintain secured access and system security while aligning to Federal Government-wide common practices.    The LBI investment was reviewed at the component level at the CBP Portfolio Review on April 10, 2014.  At that time no action items were assigned to the program for resolution.   LBI made several technology changes such as upgrading deployed technology from XP to Windows 7 to comply with DHS EA and security requirements.  These changes were deployed to improve operational efficiencies and improve the performance of business activities.  One innovation in pedestrian kiosk capabilities now supported is a many pedestrian to one officer mode and a many pedestrian to many officer mode to improve lane utilization and decrease down time.  Also several innovations were made to existing RFID and LPR technologies to enhance enterprise architecture alignment.","LBI provides technologies and infrastructure to improve border operation facilitation and security.   For inbound vehicle and pedestrian processing, RFID technologies, upgraded LPRs, an improved primary inspection application, direction variable message signage, traffic management devices, and policies like active lane management (ALM) expedite border crossing, more efficiently use scarce officer and infrastructure resources.  For example, the promotion of RFID technology and new RFID document options result in more efficient processing methods: vehicles (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without the RFID technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes.  The improved LPRs have reduced manual plate corrections by 10 million per year further reducing process time and improving security.  The benefits that accrue from the technical facilitation (RFID, LPR, VPC) of the crossing process are far reaching: increased throughput per officer, reduced border crossing wait time, and increased capacity to accommodate increases in border crossing volume.  Increased border crossing volume has a positive impact on the U.S. economy.  These capabilities also provide more enhanced information about travelers which improves border crossing security.  LBI 'returns' are calculated based on the difference in wait time prior to LBI compared to post LBI, and by estimating the value of that time for the traveling public.  The original WHTI Land Regulatory Analysis establish low, medium and high values ($ per hour) for both business and private travelers.  These value factors are multiplied by the net wait time differences to arrive at an estimated total return.  Therefore, the LBI Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated as the wait time traveler value minus the LBI investment (Acquisition and O&M) divided by the LBI investment.","LBI provided O&M support for over 490 inbound vehicle lanes where LBI hardware and software technical solutions are deployed. LBI  supports 52 pedestrian lanes, 48 Outbound lanes and 45 Border Patrol lanes.  LBI also supports over 170 handheld devices. Inbound and Outbound LPRs are meeting or exceeding their SLA performance goals of over 95% read rate accuracy and processing times at pedestrian lanes with LBI technology consistently exceed non-LBI pedestrian processing by 35%. LBI has also ensured continued optimal performance through selective refresh of critical solution components including regular configuration updates of license plate templates to incorporate new plate types and designs as State's constantly issue new and varied plate designs.","The LBI program is a steady state investment and will maintain currently deployed technology and respond to emergent issues throughout the program's life cycle.  More specifically, the program will during the following years: CY2015 - Support the full range of O&M for technology deployed by the program; deploy the re-engineered pedestrian solution to major southern border ports of entry; deploy mobile capability to realize improvements in inspection processes in multiple operating environments; upgrade Tier 3 outbound technology on the southern border to tier 2, and deploy outbound Tier 3 technology on the northern border.

SAP provides many benefits to CBP including: complete integration of business processes within one system, improved financial statement reporting and internal controls, reduced cycle-time, elimination of duplicate data entry, improved data accuracy, single system reporting, and enhanced analytical reporting. SAP ensures that CBP is in compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems. The system has dependencies to other CBP systems in the form of interfaces and data transfers that enable the accurate and complete recording of financial and associated transactions. Those systems include FedTraveler.com, Customs Overtime Scheduling System (COSS), Purchase Card System (PCS), and the CBP Automated Collection System (ACS) to name a few. SAP permits CBP to accomplish its mission with more efficiency than ever before as well as reduce functional gaps identified during past audits. The SAP Project is in a steady - state mode under the Investment Management Process. CBP is now state-of-the-art and has been identified as a leader in Financial Management by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It is critical that the SAP system be maintained and kept up to date enabling CBP to provide a high level of service in little time with utmost efficiency. Maintaining SAP will also help CBP continue receiving unqualified audit opinions.  The primary beneficiaries of the system include the over 5000 CBP field and headquarters role-based users as well as CBP and DHS management who utilize the data and information processed and reported on in SAP. Other stakeholders for the SAP program include the Office of Administration and the Office of Information Technology as co-sponsors of the program; as well as others who rely on accurate financial data from CBP.","000-000 : (Primary Program Not Available)","SAP is an ERP system and is the financial system of record for CBP.  SAP support the QHSR Mission 2:  Securing and Managing our Borders, contributes to the DHS target enterprise architecture as part of Enterprise Financial Management Portfolio (financial management function).  Technical innovation has been achieved with the development of automated budget tools within the existing CBP-SAP operational and reporting landscape that provide capability for the OA Budget Directorate to make accurate, informed decisions for agency level funding requests. This project is referred to as the SAP Budget Solutions Project. Full deployment of this project was in FY2012 and included the implementation of Profitability and Cost Management (PCM), Public Budget Formulation (PBF), and some aspects of Business Objects (BOBJ). U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations have grown substantially over the last several years. Since 2004 the value of CBP assets has grown from $9.9 billion to over $15.2 billion while the budget for CBP Salaries and Expense has grown from $3.3 billion to over $10.0 billion. The integrated budget tools capability that was implemented will enable users to track, report, and analyze budget and performance data within CBP at greater levels of granularity in a timelier manner to keep up with the dynamic environment within DHS. The solution architecture calls for automating aspects of budget formulation, execution, and cost analysis that were previously done in Microsoft Word, Excel, and Access with some data provided by the existing SAP system. The Budget Tools solution has been designed to enable and empower the CBP budget community to easily and seamlessly produce budget submissions, respond to stakeholder inquires and analyze budgets. It has alleviated the time-consuming and laborious effects associated with producing multiple budget submissions that were currently produced on cuff records, disparate worksheets, and non-uniform templates. The related performance gap involved inefficient use of time and resources to replicate what repeatable business processes, interoperability and technology can now produce. These SAP integrated Budget tools now provide automated analytical capabilities at multiple levels that were previously limited by a lack of dynamic reporting and forecasting on budgetary data.","SAP is not a new startup capability. There is no DME funding and SAP has been in O&M since 2004. The SAP program will only recover costs, it will not generate any return or cost savings, therefore has not calculated an ROI.  SAP is an integrated enterprise-wide resource planning (ERP) system that replaced ten stove-piped, outdated, and underperforming mainframe systems that CBP deemed insufficient and no longer suited to meeting data processing and reporting needs.  SAP adequately addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  SAP continues to be a good investment for CBP and the federal government.  In FY2013 with over $12 billion in budgetary resources; CBP collected over $40 billion in revenue and managed $15.9 billion in assets.  As an integrated ERP system, SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting.  CBP has received an unqualified opinion on stand-alone audits each year since 1996, running on SAP since 2004.Additionally, the SAP program measures program performance annually via the Operational Analysis; covering the following areas:  Customer Results, Strategic and Business results, Financial Performance, and Innovation.Based on the annual Office of Administration Customer Satisfaction Survey for FY2013, the SAP users and stakeholders are more satisfied in 7 of 8 survey component areas, and the SAP Overall Average Satisfaction Rating increased from a 4.00 in FY2012 to 4.04 in FY2013 out of a possible 5 across all components.  The Technical Performance Analysis of SAP shows the system availability to end users is above 99% for the 2013 fiscal year.  The Strategic and Business/Mission Analysis shows the many benefits SAP provides to CBP/DHS including:  complete integration of business processes within one system; improved financial statement reporting and internal controls; reduced cycle-time; elimination of duplicate entry; improved data accuracy; single system reporting; enhanced analytical reporting; and compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems.","Accomplishments for the investment in FY2014 include; support of year-end processing, SAP Support Pack upgrade, SAP team support related to the Shared Service project as it relates to DHS-Office of Health Administration as well as work associated with the migration from FedTraveler to the newly selected DHS-wide travel system, Concur Government Solution (CGE), and on-going help desk support for over 5,000 SAP users.

As stated in the 2014 QHSR Executive Summary-Secure and Manage our Borders, We must continue to improve upon border security-Tactical voice communication capabilities are the fundamental tools that enable coordinated activities in campus and remote environments which secure the nation's borders against illegal entry of people and goods while managing legitimate travel and trade. The goal is LMR modernization - much of the LMR equipment currently in use neither complies with NTIA narrow-banding mandates nor supports Project 25 interoperability standards. Finally, equipment has surpassed expected service life - spare parts are scarce and unsupported by vendors. Significant benefits include a three-fold increase in previously deficient coverage areas and improved NTIA compliance. Quality of secure voice is being enhanced by implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard capabilities, protecting law-enforcement sensitive voice communications. CBP owns, operates, and maintains one of the largest tactical voice communications infrastructures in the Federal government. This supports the DHS mission - Secure and Manage Our Borders. Legacy LMR systems and infrastructure, that CBP inherited, provided critical tactical voice communications for key customers. Beneficiaries include over 44,000 agents and officers from CBP's operational component stakeholder organizations: The Office of Border Patrol, the Office of Field Operations, and the Office of Air and Marine. CBP's missions and operations securing and managing our borders can only be achieved through cooperative coordination with Federal departments and agencies (e.g. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Interior, United States Department of Agriculture, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Transportation and interagency partners like U.S. Coast Guard. It also relies upon partnerships with State, local, tribal, territorial, and international law enforcement agencies) to share information and conduct coordinated and integrated operations.","024-042 : Securing America's Borders","TACCOM supports DHS Strategic Plan Mission #2, Securing and Managing our Borders and DHS IRM Goal #1 Establish secure IT services and capabilities to protect the Homeland and enhance our Nation's preparedness, mitigation, and recovery capabilities. The IRM goal supports the DHS Enterprise Roadmap Section 5.11 Tactical Communications Segment Architecture's (TACCOM) purpose: DHS Components rely heavily on tactical communications to communicate critical information to, from, and among field personnel. Although TACCOM capabilities are essential to many of the Department's missions, many systems in use today are outdated or are insufficient to meet critical user needs. At the same time, advances in wireless technologies over the past decade and recent support from the Administration and Congress for advancing public safety wireless communications efforts, such as the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network, present DHS with significant opportunities to both improve its TACCOM capabilities and gain efficiencies through standardization and partnerships with internal and external stakeholders. CBP is responsible for securing the nation's borders against illegal entry of people and goods while facilitating legitimate travel and trade. To support this mission, CBP operates and maintains one of the largest Federal Land Mobile Radio (LMR) tactical voice communications infrastructures. Tactical communication capabilities are essential to coordinating mission activities and protecting the safety of over 44,000 CBP law enforcement personnel. These agents/officers operate in remote areas; radios are often their only communications channel to coordinate activities or summon assistance. By improving coverage-capacity-reliability-encryption, TACCOM provides critical communication support to CBP personnel who secure the nation's borders. Technical innovation is achieved through TACCOM projects that perform a technological refresh of LMR devices used by CBP law enforcement in their daily duties. Decades-old analog configured equipment is upgraded with latest/secure technology P25 standards based digital devices with advanced communication encryption. Other technological innovation includes the TACCOM objective to obtain a commercially available Standards based IP networking solution that allows the migration of all CBP infrastructure to an Internet Protocol platform and provides the basis for allowing interoperability with other P25, non-p25, and commercial technologies.","CBP TACCOM Program goal is to provide CBP officers and agents an upgraded LMR communications system, while complying with the P25 standard Federal mandates. These LMR systems are a primary communications lifeline, critical to mission execution and officer safety. TACCOM PMO developed an AoA that included a Return on Investment (ROI) analysis used to calculate the most cost effective modernization and implementation strategy that met all the Program Office's requirements. The government benefits are improved operational availability (refreshing obsolete equipment/reduced maintenance cost), system coverage (innovative technology-increased remote communications capabilities), network capacity (increased secure information capabilities), security (advanced transmitted information encryption), situational awareness (faster incident responses), interoperability (multi-agency communication capabilities), and efficiency (reduced maintenance, clear digital transmissions). Internally, these benefits afford the government designed efficiencies that: Align with mandated architectures at Federal and Agency levels; align with government roadmaps for Tactical Communication such as section 5.11 Tactical Communications Segment Architecture's (TACCOM) purpose, see response 9.b.; support and enhance the DHS mission of protecting the nation's borders, and reinforcing government accountability. Externally, these benefits provide same-technology-level tactical communications between government law enforcement/emergency management and external partners, as many external partners currently employ modernized communication capabilities. This leads to quicker incident/emergency responses times where rapid response times allow efficient information dissemination to external government organizations bolstering government transparency and accountability. Externally, these benefits provide the ultimate value to U.S. citizens through increased citizen safety/border protection. Alternative analysis tools used-MS Excel; Automated Cost Estimating Integrated Tools Cost Estimating Relationship Library Tool; Crystal Ball. Based on requirements and analysis, three alternatives considered-Conventional VoteScan LMR; Trunked LMR; Simulcast LMR. Detailed analysis included developing viable alternative LCCEs to compare to the Status Quo LMR to conduct a financial analysis.

The Program follows ICE's System Lifecycle Methodology (SLM) to build a forward-thinking EA-compliant solution.OCIO will use the DHS cloud-computing environment to offer on-demand infrastructure services to provide the development, testing, integration, and production environments. This approach provides benefits through the sharing of resources, reducing the cycle time for establishing new environments, and enabling the environments to be right-sized to the HSI workload. In keeping with ICE's IT Strategic Plan, the solution will use single sign-on to ease the administrative burden of accessing multiple computing resources; track case information and past history of subjects under investigation; and provide enhanced search, reporting, and data sharing capabilities for employees and partners.  The TECS Mod architecture provides the foundation to expand ICE's focus on service-oriented design that will allow the Agency to provide more information from additional sources of data while bringing solutions to bear more quickly by leveraging an ever-growing number of technical services. The TECS Mod solution supports the development of data interoperability standards and will be an active partner in government information sharing initiatives, such as NIEM - a framework of data exchange standards to enable organizations to automate law enforcement and public safety information sharing across all levels of government. The TECS Mod solution will specifically address DHS IT Strategy goals to: 1) Establish secure IT services and capabilities to protect the Homeland and enhance our Nation's preparedness, mitigation and recovery capabilities; and 2) Strengthen and unify the Department's ability to share information and services internally and with Federal, State, local, tribal, international and private industry partners.

ATS uses intelligence info and technology to target suspect inbound and outbound shipments for exams and passengers for inspection. ATS allows CBP officers to focus their efforts on cargo shipments and passengers consistent with current threats. ATS standardizes names, addresses, ship names, and similar data so these data elements can be more easily associated with other business data to form a more complete picture of a passengers, import, or export in context with previous behavior of the parties involved. Every passenger and shipment processed through ATS is subject to a real-time risk evaluation. Risk assessment strategies are multi-tiered in their approach and are founded on complex statistical studies, data analyses, and rules based on knowledge engineering. ATS provides selectivity and target capability to support CBP inspection and enforcement activities. As volumes of data increase in people, cargo, and conveyances, officers require increasingly efficient access to more relevant real-time info on which to base critical admission decisions.  The ATS systems address data quality improvements to ensure efforts are focused on only those persons and cargo that present most probable threats to the homeland.  The beneficiaries and key customers of ATS are: CBP Officers and Analysts, the CBP National Targeting Center, CBP Office of Field Operations, CBP Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, CBP Office of International Trade, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Public. Stakeholders include: DHS/CBP (OIIL, OFO, and OIT). ATS utilizes information received from TECS, APIS, and other systems identified in the Enterprise Architecture tab. Specific quant. benefits include pos. rule and name based matches of passengers identified as a potential threat.  To date (May 2014) 45,876 positive matches were identified (over the baseline, 2x the # of matches from FY13).  ATS serves 79,000 users and is used to analyze over 17M transactions per day.  Total ATS passengers and cargo systems maintain uptimes of 100% and 99% respectfully.  Additional metrics capture the # of passengers denied boarding through pre-screening efforts and rule based matches, and the # of cargo shipments received and examed.","024-041 : Intelligence and Targeting","ATS is listed as the targeting program for Customs and Border Protection and assists with TSA and ICE in their efforts in detection of potential threats from passengers and cargo. ATS is designated as the targeting system for DHS and as such contributes to the agencies target EA.   ATS continues to work jointly with the NTC, OIIL, and other foreign entities to jointly perform targeting operations.  Mobile devices are used to assist with targeting individuals as well as maintaining manifests of cargo for real time data tracking and efficiencies. This provides a strategic advantage saving valuable time and resources dedicated to detecting potential threats.  ATS also utilizes user defined rules and predictive modeling as technical innovation to detect patterns and screen individuals and cargo for potential threats.  Rule implementation assist with the reduction in false positives.  The reduction in false positives helps streamline targeting efforts and processing efficiency to agents.  Coordination and collaboration with the NTC has helped to spur innovation through shared data and information resources reducing time and increasing vetting efforts.  These efforts have assisted with advances in targeting capabilities and methodologies of intelligence driven targeting.  An example of this is PX Search which uses natural language processing, logistic regression and bayesian classification models help to extend existing capabilities to further improve matching precision to reduce labor, increase processing speed, and increase targeting accuracy. ATS was included in the DHS Joint Portfolio Review in May of 2012.  ATS did not have any action items related to the review.  The recommendation for the investment was to continue operations and maintenance of the targeting systems.","ATS, in operations since 2004, cont. to provide a significant ROI by streamlining the processing of passengers and cargo while increasing the likelihood of identifying threats to the Homeland (e.g., narcotics or weapons). ATS has no DME funding and has been in O&M since 2004. ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by streamlining data on passengers and cargo. By providing hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and pass., officers and agents are provided valuable info for a potential action. This is an invaluable resource capability. ATS also cont. to provide quality data by cont. working with other government agencies to eliminate derog. matches or pot. threats that are deemed false positives. ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characts. provide information that assists in better targeting efforts.ATS benefits can be described through the # of persons of interest denied entry into the U.S. and cargo that is not allowed into the U.S. I.e., the SAS model within ATS has captured over $64.7 million dollars (street value) worth of Cocaine, Heroin, Meth, and Marijuana as of June 2014.  This serves as evidence for senior leadership's review of the Southwest Border Counter Narcotics Strategy. ATS serves DHS Mission of Securing and Managing our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a signif. benefit to the public.  This incl. ident. of pos. matches that require 2ndary inspection on over 45k passengers and the scanning over 137M air, ocean, rail, truck, and pedestrian modes of cargo (of which over 1M were targeted for examination) as of May FY14.  ATS helps secure lawful trade and travel which is vital in national security and instrumental for public safety.  Governmentally, ATS utilizes instrumental system engineering techniques to maintain a system of systems capability throughout DHS.  ATS comm. with the various stakeholders to provide needed capabilities and data dissemination to these entities that are utilized to target and capture potential threats.   ATS is used as a source system to target threats and provide the info to boots on the ground teams that can then make an informed decision on a pass. or cargo event.","Cost, Schedule, and Performance are monitored thru regular program reviews and periodic reporting.  ATS consistently achieves its performance objectives on schedule and w/n budget. Accomplishments include:- Process 1.9M non-immigrant Visa Applications from DOS's 20 Visa Posts-37k derogatory matches (possible threats) identified-Vetting from NTC-P and ICE Analysts found that of these 37k, 2,842 applicants were positive matches (prob. threats)-Refresh of the Southern Border Trucking Narcotics Risk Model increased targeting by 36%.  This reduced anomalies and significantly increased targeting effectiveness-Ocean International Property Rights Model targeted 495 seizures in FY14 to date and led to a total MSRP of over $273M dollars-SAS model captured over $64M worth of narcotics from August 2013 to dateThese accomplishments all performed better than expected and exceeded all targets.  Additional metrics for FY15 and beyond are captured in the annual Operational Analysis.","ATS initiatives are constant due to the nature of the operations and maintenance activities of the program.

ACE will accomplish this by delivering an automated processing system for handling commercial importations, strengthening targeting and selectivity capabilities.  This falls in line with the DHS mission of Securing and Managing our Borders. ACE will deliver these capabilities in a secure, paper-free, web environment. ACE is being built using an incremental approach that features a series of releases.  Each release will leverage the foundation components and functionality present in previous releases and bring new capabilities to the trade and government users.   ACE will replace ACS in 2016. ACE supports the international trade data needs of over 100 federal agencies.  International trade processes include data collection, processing, dissemination, and storage.  ACE will become the central trade data collection system for all federal agencies, and the single point of access for this data. ACE will provide considerable benefits to CBP, such as enhanced targeting of high-risk shipments, automation enabling CBP to process cargo faster (such as reduced truck processing time) and focus on border security tasks, improved, timely inter-agency information sharing, analysis, and investigation, more efficient workflow and reduction of costly labor and paper intensive activities (such as cost savings to the trade due to reduced border wait times), better reports and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations for Government and private sector, better compliance with legislation requiring greater Government efficiency and effectiveness to better serve the public. ACE customers are; CBP, PGAs, and Trade. CBP includes border and trade enforcement personnel who use ACE to process shipments arriving into the US. Trade includes commercial entities that import, ship, insure and provide brokerage services to those importing goods into the US. PGAs include more than 47 government agencies responsible for the licensing and admissibility of cargo into the U.S.   A key goal of ACE development and delivery is an effective training and organizational change management effort to ensure a seamless deployment and a high degree of acceptance by users. Workforce transformation is based on two principles: prepare both CBP and stakeholders to succeed in their roles; and minimize the disruption of key operations.","024-043 : Securing and Expediting Trade","ACE aligns to the QHSR Mission 2: Secure and Manage Our Borders. It also contributes to the DHS Target EA as part of the Screening Portfolio. The CSPD Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) is the blueprint for the execution, management, and control of the technical aspects of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) program from conception to disposal.  The new ACE system will be developed using the Agile development methodology.  In an Agile environment only a very limited amount of the system design is performed up-front with somewhat more being done just ahead of the development effort.  The bulk of the design is actually performed by the development teams as part of the development process.  This in turn requires that the various systems engineering disciplines are applied incrementally.The Technical Architecture provides the building codes for the development of ACE.  It is based on the CBP Target Architecture.  Where the CBP Target Architecture provides a specific direction, ACE will follow that direction.  Where the CBP Target Architecture - or one of its components, such as the Technical Reference Manual, provides a range of choices for the various program offices, the ACE Technical Architecture will provide a specific choice for the ACE program.  The ACE Technical Architecture particularizes the CBP Target Architecture and the various other CBP architectures.The Technical Architecture describes the structure of the system and provides the framework on which the system will be developed. It includes the:*         Application architecture; *         Data architecture; and*         Infrastructure architecture.The ACE Transition Architecture shows the basic structure of the system including both the major components of the new system and its access to legacy data still housed in the legacy systems.  The transition architecture also shows the common interfaces that will need to be developed.  The overall breakdown of systems and services will look very different from the very functional orientation of the current system.  The initial functional breakdown of the system into major system components will be:E-Manifest;Cargo Release and Entry Summary;Account Management (Customer Relationship Management (CRM));Partner Government Agency (PGA) Messaging / International Trade Data System (ITDS); andExport.Each of these major systems will be further decomposed by the A&E Team prior to the start of the full scale Agile development.","The following is the explanation on ROI as stated in the attached AoA document:The Return On Investment (ROI) indicates the percent saved in future O&M dollars for every dollar spent on the initial investment. ROI is based on the following O&M savings in the following areas: *          Help desk support -Application, hardware and software maintenance -*          Data center labor -*          User Training and Materials -Security Testing *          Operational analyses due to lower usage of the mainframe platform *          Efficiencies from the CBP target architecture *          Reduced licensing costs *          Shared system components *          Standardizing certification and accreditation *          Improving scalability and reliability and instituting open standards. The benefits of modernizing to a more efficient electronic interface will enhance communications between CBP, PGAs, and the Trade. The improved communications will provide time savings for entry corrections and allow for more timely cargo processing. For example, the Document Imaging System (DIS) will enable paper forms to be received and processed electronically, providing more efficiency at the Port of Entry (POE) and saving time and money for the government and the Trade.  Ultimately the new functionality is freeing up more time for port personnel to perform mission work rather than clerical and administrative tasks.","On March 22, 2014 AES was retired, and its functionality was subsumed by ACE.

AFI has evolved into a data analysis and intelligence product creation and dissemination platform that supports multiple DHS components, specifically CBP and ICE.  AFI provides technology and tools that produce timely and actionable intelligence for DHS personnel protecting our borders, enhances collaboration across DHS intelligence analysts in a shared workspace, and more effectively shares threat information and intelligence to other Federal partners charged with securing our nation. AFI shortens the time and expense in disseminating intelligence products to intelligence analysts in the field because reports are posted in a main repository and distributed to pre-identified communities. AFI serves as the one-stop shop for CBP and ICE-produced intelligence products with access available to intelligence organizations throughout DHS. AFI leverages existing legacy systems and provides an enhanced query, analysis, production, collaboration, and dissemination tool.  AFI provides an automated function that integrates information from multiple systems into a single platform that reduces manual effort and saves users valuable time.  AFI aligns with the DHS QHSR goals and CBP goals.  One goal includes QHSR Mission 1 Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security.  AFI focuses on identifying the tools and conveyances used by terrorists and apply knowledge to remain at the forefront of global law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts. More information is provided in the Operational Analysis.Specific stakeholders include intelligence analysts, agents, and officers working for CBP offices including OFO, OBP, OAM, OT, and OIIL. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations directorate is also a major AFI stakeholder community. Other stakeholders from DHS include the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the TSA. AFI is accessible to law enforcement representatives from the Department of Justice including the Drug Enforcement Administration. AFI will also share information with the Intelligence Community and potentially law enforcement partners at the State, local, and tribal levels.  Beneficiaries include the U.S. public, ICE analysts, and CBP officers and analysts.","024-041 : Intelligence and Targeting","AFI aligns to the DHS missions of Preventing Terrorism/Enhancing Security and Securing and Managing Our Borders. AFI is a data analysis and intelligence product creation and dissemination platform that supports multiple DHS components, specifically Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). AFI provides technology and tools that produce timely and actionable intelligence to DHS personnel charged with protecting our nation from threats posed by the illegal cross-border movement of goods and people, including the threat of terrorist activity. AFI enhances collaboration between intelligence analysts in shared workspaces and effectively shares information and intelligence to other Federal partners charged with securing our nation.Since AFI became an operational system in August 2012, no formal evaluation of AFI, as an enterprise service, has been initiated, but AFI has been working with ICE HSI to transition their users, intelligence production processes, and finished intelligence products from the Intelligence Fusion System (IFS) prior to its end of FY 2013 shutdown. AFI is also working with DHS I&A and USCIS to evaluate the potential use of AFI by those organizations. AFI does utilize enterprise services, for example, by providing access to geospatial data through the DHS Bing roadmap and imagery layer service.AFI provides programmatic and technical innovation by allowing access to data, information and intelligence by authorized CBP and ICE (and potentially other DHS components in the near future) users. For example, CBP and ICE intelligence analysts are able to search multiple data systems (e.g., TECS, Electronic System for Travel Authorization, Advanced Passenger Information System) to identify potential illegal activity, share search results, analyze data across various analytical tools, collaborate and share information with other intelligence analysts, and create, review, submit for approval, and publish finished intelligence products. AFI currently provides users access to over three dozen data sources owned by CBP, ICE, Department of State and commercial data providers. Future releases of AFI will include access to data systems owned by other DHS components, other Federal agencies, and State and Local law enforcement authorities. AFI also serves as the one-stop resource for CBP and ICE produced intelligence products with access planned to be available to intelligence organizations in other DHS components.","The return on investment for AFI includes quantifiable and non-quantifiable factors.  The calculation is primarily driven by two quantifiable benefits: cost savings/cost avoidance, and services/products delivered to internal customers.  The first measure derives from the value of not hiring additional intelligence analysts over the number required for AFI. The second benefit denotes the projected value of intelligence products created in AFI.  The AFI program creates efficiencies in collating and disseminating intelligence products, allowing for increased effectiveness and efficiency for CBP officers, Border Patrol and Air and Marine agents in utilizing strategic and practical intelligence at and between ports of entry.  The ROI also includes non-quantifiable benefits.  'Other' benefits are positive contributions of the AFI program that cannot readily be categorized numerically, such as improving identification and targeting of potential terrorists and terrorist weapons through risk management and automated advanced and enhanced information, and preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States at ports of entry.  The AFI ROI was calculated to factor in the projected value of benefits, new and previous O&M costs, and capital investment costs. The co-location of a variety of analytical tools will reduce the expenditure of separate offices purchasing multiple licenses and software packages by moving to an enterprise solution.  AFI continues to be on the forefront of intelligence driven information sharing.  This is critical to CBP intelligence gathering, analysis, user satisfaction.  Analysts utilize the AFI system to make critical decision based solutions based on automated information.  This is vital for collaboration between DHS components and multiple systems of use.","Accomplishments in PY14:  -Integration of IFS data for ICE.

Commercial carriers or private aircraft provide APIS information from the biographic information found in travel documents prior to traveler boarding of commercial vessels or commercial or private aircraft.  Data is transmitted to CBP electronically prior to departure.  CBP screens the information against law enforcement databases containing lookout records from many agencies including the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify travelers who are a threat to national security and should not be allowed to travel, and target travelers who need additional inspection upon arrival at a Port of Entry (POE). APIS facilitates clearance of legitimate travelers. APIS is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures and identify travelers who overstay under immigration laws. APIS reviews passengers and crew to identify possible terrorists or other high-risk individuals and facilitates clearance of legitimate travelers. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, requires commercial air and sea carriers to electronically transmit arrival and departure manifests for each commercial vessel or aircraft prior to arrival at or departure from the U.S. This includes matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, as well as, analytical support for air carrier performance. Changed operational parameters let APIS handle increased volume more efficiently, collect inbound and outbound data for air and sea passengers, convert to World Customs Organization standards for data transmission (UN EDIFACT) and acquire and process Canadian and Mexican APIS data for passengers traveling from overseas. eAPIS and eNOA/D are web-based internet accessible functions developed to allow air carriers and vessels operating without advance departure control systems to transmit data electronically to CBP. Small/medium air carriers can upload data to CBP, acknowledge receipt of  data to transmitting carriers, and allow carriers to view and request performance reports.Key Customers are CBP Office of Field Ops, TSA , Dept.of State, commercial airlines, vessel carriers, domestic terminals and U.S. POEs. Stakeholders are CBP OFO, CBP, TSA and DoS.","024-044 : Securing and Expediting Travel","APIS when its code and data base are fully modernized by the TECS Modernization Program will fully align to CBP's Enterprise Technical Architecture 2.0 (ETA 2.0), the agency's target EA framework. The modernized application and database will use the EA principle of architecting, designing and planning, and implementation to ensure the applications will work on the ETA 2.0 Common Delivery Platform (CDP), a vendor agnostic, standard based architecture and the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).  Using the ETA 2.0 framework will also ensure APIS business capabilities conform to the agency's technology and security architecture, Department of Homeland Security IT Strategic Goals and be compliant with the Federal CIO 25 Point Program. TECS Modernization uses and eventually APIS (Manifest Processing after modernization) will use the agency targeted technology of CBP Cloud Computing Environment (C3E), an open-sourced storage, compute, network and operating system that prepares the application to comply with the Federal Cloud First policy.  This innovation ensures that TECS Mod applications are highly reliable, available and scalable for future growth.  C3E manageability reduces the total cost of ownership by reusing shared system components, sharing licenses and sharing operations and maintenance with other agency applications following ETA 2.0.  The modernized APIS will architect candidate services for external interfaces that will run on the ESB's service oriented architecture (SOA).  The developed services allow CBP internal and external stakeholders to collaborate and efficiently share information to meet their business mission needs.   APIS, when fully modernized by the TECS Modernization investment, will architect and transition the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to the Identity, Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) security architecture when the agency's ICAM best practice and guidelines is released.  This ensures APIS will maintain secured access and system security while aligning to Federal government-wide common practices.","The Program does not have a return on investment because it has not prepared a Cost Benefit Analysis.  The program has been in sustainment since 2002 and has been exempted from the preparation of Acquisition Documentation by the Under Secretary for Management, Mr. Raphael Boras.  Mr. Boras's Acquisition Decision Memorandum of May 9, 2013,  states that programs in sustainment prior to 2008 are exempt from the requirement to prepare acquisition documentation.  A copy of that ADM has been appended to the IMS.In terms of benefits external to the government, APIS, based on estimates published in the APIS proposed rule, the eAPIS automated report generation module has saved the small carriers $86,676,000 in development costs (14,446 carriers x $6,000 cost). The $6,000 cost was calculated by utilizing the estimate in the proposed rule as to the estimated programming costs ($7,200) and subtracting the estimated cost for a personal computer ($1,200) to access APIS.  The annual savings to carriers is half that previously stated as the need to perform on-going maintenance is eliminated.In general operational terms, APIS has proven to be exceptionally valuable and useful.  APIS data is critical to CBP biographical entry/exit systems.  APIS is the single best method by which CBP obtains advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  The apprehension of the Times Square Bomber is the most visible recent example in that APIS alerted CBP that the bomber was attempting to flee the country and where he could be apprehended.","In the prior year, the APIS team sustained APIS.   Additionally, they performed a limited APIS Carrier Support Services upgrade along with limited upgrades to eAPIS support module (an internal subsystem/application of APIS) and APIS Quick Query (Name by Name) operational functionality.  The APIS team also prepared APIS data validity checks and ensured the continued operations of APIS.","In the current year, the APIS team will sustain APIS:  APIS team will on APIS Carrier Support Services, eAPIS support module and APIS Quick Query.  Operations and maintenance work includes limited enhancement of operational functionality, examination and purification of data, and will coordinate extensively with the TECS Modernization team that will continue with the development and modernization of the Manifest Processing module of HPPQ&MP.  In the BY, the team will perform limited operational functionality enhancements to the same three modules if TECS Modernization has not completed, but will primarily be working on the detailed aspects of data migration and data management activities in support of the TECS Modernization HPPQ and MP (Manifest Processing) project.

The NII Program seeks to match the technology and equipment with the threat, conditions and requirements at, and between, domestic Ports of Entry (POE's) and U.S. facilities that process international mail. The NII inspections also create an economic benefit to commerce by expediting the flow of goods through the inspection process to avoid costly time delays. The expedited inspection process saves the trade industry an estimated 0.5-percent to 1.5-percent increase to the cost of goods that would be created if manual inspections were performed. The goal of the NII Program is to provide technologies that assist in minimizing risk to personnel at and between U.S. POE's without sacrificing the facilitation of legitimate trade and traffic. An additional goal is to maximize the number of contraband seizures and to purchase, test, and deploy LS/SS NII systems to achieve sufficient operating capability for detection of a wide range of contraband that is imported using a variety of smuggling methods in various conveyances while maintaining a 95 percent average operational availability of NII equipment. The primary customers are the CBP Officers and Border Patrol Agents who use NII technologies to inspect cargo and conveyances for contraband. Resulting from almost $500 billion in U.S. trade between Mexico and over $600 billion with Canada. Stakeholders include importers, brokers, seaport terminal operators, airport operators and other businesses with an interest in frictionless surface trade. Specifically, the Port Authorities, Coast Guard, Law Enforcement, Labor Representatives, etc. A second group includes those who focus on preventing terrorist attacks or the entry of contraband. Those stakeholders include manufacturers of large-scale and small-scale imaging equipment; Federal agencies who have a responsibility to monitor and avert potential bio-terrorist attacks; and Federal, state and local agencies who have an interest in intercepting contraband. The beneficiaries of the program are American citizens who benefit from its contribution to Preventing Terrorism, Enhancing National Security, and Securing and Managing U.S. borders.","024-042 : Securing America's Borders","The NII Systems Program contributes to the DHS Enterprise Architecture through multiple activities and initiatives. For example, NII leaders continue to work with users to evaluate the Program's baseline performance, business practices, data uses, and technologies to ensure it meets current and future mission needs. Gaps between the baseline and target are identified and followed by implementation or action plans to achieve mission performance improvements. The Program's role in the Enterprise Roadmap is to optimize deployment of NII technologies across air, land and sea POE's given identified risks and available funds based on gap analyses. This means pursuing a mix of technologies designed to complement one another and present a layered defense while efficiently processing a significant volume of passengers and trade. Based on funding availability, the NII Program will achieve and maintain technical innovation through a combination of market surveys, Requests for Information, Industry Day events where CBP leaders discuss current and future needs, meetings with vendors that focus on new or enhanced NII capabilities, innovation clauses in NII contracts, and DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Organization (DNDO) and the DHS Science and Technology organization research and development initiatives. For example, advanced technologies under review include DNDO's Nuclear and Radiological Imaging Platform Advanced Technology Demonstration for the design/construction/testing of a NII cargo inspection system that can be used to detect nuclear materials and non-nuclear contraband and offer material identification or discrimination. A recent decision was made by the Office of Field Operations (OFO) to incorporate PRIDE and ARDIS into the scope of the NII Systems Program documentation. PRIDE and ARDIS were funded by the NII Program as part of a Business Transformational Initiative to re-engineer POE processes to automate more administrative tasks and focus staff on core operational activities. The PRIDE and ARDIS projects supports reach back analysis of radiation detected by qualified analysts. CBP is currently developing a program plan to merge the PRIDE/ARDIS projects into the NII System Program's scope including the DHS Acquisition Review Process, Systems Engineering Life Cycle Process, Capital Planning and Investment Control Process, Enterprise Architecture Process, IT Security Process, supporting documentation and reporting requirements.","The Return on Investment (ROI) for the NII Program is based on the benefits of using LS and SS non-intrusive technology for inspections of cargo, vehicles, and persons entering the United States at, and between, POE's. The ROI estimated in the FY06-FY07 Analysis of Alternatives has been validated in subsequent years.  An analysis of inspection technology and protocols in FY11-FY12 showed LS technology conducts inspections in an average of 6.7% of the time required for manual inspections. In FY2013, 22.5 million cargo laden conveyances with a market value of $1.1 trillion entered the United States at the 80 Land and Sea Cargo POE's and their associated crossings and terminals. Of the 22.5 million cargo conveyances, NII technology scanned 7.5 million. Without using NII technology the same number of exams would have required approximately 9,000 additional CBPOs. Small-scale technology analysis shows similar efficiencies. The number of inspections per year and the cost for them was calculated for manual inspections and for technology use. The speed, accuracy, and cost of the inspections used in the ROI calculations also included the external benefits to commerce. This was measured in terms of the costs for waiting times. Inspection technology accelerates the movement of legitimate trade and travel by reducing the time to conduct cargo and commercial vehicle examination. The greatest qualitative benefits of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism. The increased number and the improved quality of cargo inspections will decrease the probability that WMD or other articles or instruments of terrorism will enter the United States. The use of NII equipment will help CBP officers detect and interdict WMD. They also will be more likely to detect and prevent other weapons and destructive devices from entering the United States. NII equipment will also aid in the identification and prevention of undeclared currency and contraband being smuggled into the United States and in the prevention of patent and trademark infringements. In addition, NII equipment will aid in the regulation and enforcement of fair trade. As identification and interdiction increase through the use of NII equipment, illegal activity will have an increasingly high cost, which will serve as a deterrent. The NII Systems Program will make life and property safer from terrorism, will reduce drug traffic, and will help prevent illegal commerce.","FY2014:  Studies on system availability due to aging/maintenance continue on a yearly basis to track availability vs costs NII acquisition plans (APs)/RFPs/RFQs combining maintenance with purchases were included in all new APs  CBP requested acquisition funds in FY14, none provided, deployed systems were procured with prior-year funding  In FY14, LS systems conducted over 4.7 million exams with seizures of over 192,000 lbs. of narcotics Plan: Deploy 19 LS and 33 SS x-ray systems for existing ports; Actual: 18 due to insufficient funds Successfully completed transition of fixed LS-NII from CBP storage (1) and a test site (1) to the Long Beach Terminal and vendor as GFE for upgrading in support of a public-private partnership agreement LS Post Implementation Review (PIR).

NII is conducting an analysis for how to obtain full funding or restructure the program for FY16-20. To provide for new acquisition, testing, deployment and training, funding must continue through FY20. Some of this cost can be shifted to O&M to extend equipment end-of-life. This is a program risk as high cost capital equipment will reach the end of its operational lifecycle in this timeframe. The program is validating minimum acceptable field equipment requirements, allocating equipment and resources to mitigate highest risk areas, decommissioning unneeded equipment from inventory, and purchasing and deploying new equipment that can provide higher inspection efficiencies. These actions are guided by the 95% availability requirement for NII imaging equipment. A Program Operational Analysis (OA) was completed in June 2014.

"024-000005670","834","024","Department of Homeland Security","45","Transportation Security Administration","TSA - Air Cargo Security","The purpose of this investment is to ensure the security of passenger aircraft that carry cargo. The primary goal of the investment is to support the systems that enable TSA to regulate activities of Air Carriers and Indirect Air Carriers; regulate and approve companies to conduct screening operations; and determine the identity, validity and risk of companies shipping goods on passenger aircraft.  The investment provides a layered approach to security that supports Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Mission 1.1: Prevent Terrorist Attacks. The investment consists of 3 major operation systems, IACMS, KSMS, and FAS, and 2 minor systems, STAT and DAT, that serve to capture and manage data, all of which enable TSA to deliver its mission. IACMS manages the IAC certification and renewal process, ensuring that IACs implement standard security programs that reduce terrorism risk.  IACMS also enables IACs to obtain Security Threat Assessments for their employees and agents, vetting individuals to reduce the threat of insiders introducing explosive or incendiary devices into commerce. KSMS vets shippers, reducing the likelihood that a shipper would introduce such a device.  FAS provides the ability to continually verify that all cargo is being screened in compliance with federal law; ensuring that if devices are introduced, they will be found prior to being shipped on an aircraft.Primary benefits of this investment relate to reduced costs, improved efficiency, and improved oversight of regulated parties. Through the deployment of web services, implementing usability improvements, automation of manual processes, and the expansion of system capabilities, benefits include decreased time required for the vetting process, decreased transaction costs, decreased workload during the vetting process, increased data quality, and decreased time required to produce Congressionally mandated reports.Key internal stakeholders, customers, and beneficiaries include the Consolidated Screening Gateway, Certified Cargo Screening Program Office, TSA Cargo Inspectors, and Regional Compliance Coordinators. Key external stakeholders, customers, and beneficiaries include passenger Air Carriers, all-cargo carriers, Indirect Air Carriers, cargo trucking agents, companies shipping goods via passenger aircraft, Certified Cargo Screening Facilities, airports, and aircraft passengers.","024-025 : Intermodal Screening Operations","The investment's systems align with the DHS Enterprise Roadmap Section 4.3, Screening Portfolio. The systems support the vetting of individuals and companies with access to passenger aircraft and seek to ensure the safety of passenger aircraft. Electronic reporting capabilities are being provided by FAS in order for Indirect Air Carriers, Air Carriers, and Certified Screening Facilities to report screening volumes. The reporting of screening volumes aligns with the DHS Enterprise Roadmap and the Screening Portfolio strategy and performance goal 1.1, Prevent Terrorist Attacks. This electronic reporting improves data quality, distributes the reporting workload by enabling field sites to report independently, and decreases the time required to produce congressionally mandated reports. Current innovative efforts are focused on improving system efficiencies and decreasing costs. Usability improvements are currently being implemented within IACMS and KSMS in order to decrease help desk call volume and help desk costs, and improve user satisfaction with these systems. Vetting capabilities of KSMS have been expanded to include shippers located in Canada and Mexico. This capability expansion allows the vetting process for Canadian and Mexican shippers to transition from a manual process, which requires annual in-person site visits, to an automated vetting process performed by TSA.  This makes it easier for IACs and Aircraft Operators to ship goods from Canadian and Mexican shippers, opens new markets, and adds potential customers for IACs and Aircraft Operators. In order to continue implementing technical innovation, the portfolio plans to work with industry to increase the number of web-services users. Through the use of web services, IACs and ACs will be able to access the vetting service provided by KSMS directly through their corporate information system, thus providing seamless integration between the familiarity of the corporate system and the functionality provided by KSMS.","The layered approach to Air Cargo Security is the most cost effective means of ensuring the security of passenger air cargo, which blends several layers of security together, reducing or eliminating single points of failure. As noted in the Air Cargo Final Rule (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-08-18/pdf/2011-20840.pdf) the main benefit of this approach is the improved security of the traveling public through reduction in the risk of an explosive or incendiary device being placed on an aircraft from the passenger air cargo mode, and an overall decrease in the risk of terrorism. It is difficult to determine how many planes would be destroyed by terrorism absent of the Air Cargo Security Program's approach; however, the program can conservatively assume that its systems can help prevent a terrorist incident on 1 flight per year, saving 0.00000012% (1 flight/8,315,000 domestic flights in 2013 according to transtats.bts.gov) of the nation's annual domestic flights from potential acts of terrorism.   As a part of the final rule, TSA also estimated the cost of a terrorist incident to be $732.5M per incident. Air Cargo estimates the potential total cost avoidance to be $5.856B (1 incident x 8  years (total lifecycle) x $732.5M) and the program's total cost avoidance to be $585.6M (conservatively allocating 10% of this total cost, as the program plays a portion of the nation's layered approach to aviation security). Therefore the program calculates its return on investment (ROI) to be 1.31 ((Cost Avoidance/Risk Adjusted Total Lifecycle Cost of Program) -1). The $253.7M in Air Cargo Security program costs will be recovered and the program will then return $1.31 in terrorist incident avoidance costs for every dollar invested into the program.","The accomplishments listed below are for the FY2014(PY).KSMS--Added search by Name/Address function for TSA Inspectors to improve search capability.--Changes to improve usability and performance.--Addressed security vulnerabilities.IACMS--Updated the STA submission and management process to improve usability.--Improved application's compatibility with multiple Internet browsers.--Addressed security vulnerabilities.--Deployed updates which significantly improved system performance.FAS--Addressed a number of usability issues and security vulnerabilities.--Updates to the core FAS product to improve system flexibility.--Added functionality to allow users to perform common administrative functions directly through the user interface.STAT/DAT--Added STA expiration capability to STAT.","The investment's high level objectives for the CY, BY, and budget out years are to: (1) improve the usability of the Air Cargo systems, (2) streamline the process for performing frequently used functions, (3) remediate all outstanding security weaknesses, (4) improve 508 accessibility compliance, and (5) sustain system usability.

CAII supports DHS Mission Area #2: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security, and ICE Strategic Plan Objective 1.2: Removal of Individuals Posing a Security Threat, by providing solutions that assist the key customers, stakeholders and beneficiaries, including: Law Enforcement Support Center Law Enforcement Specialists; ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Agents; and other Federal, State, Local and Tribal law enforcement agents and officers.CAII will provide the following benefits:- Expand information sharing among state, local, and federal partners.- Provide a scalable system that can handle changes in demand, is flexible to enable future enhancements, and is adaptable to providing functionality to other ICE and DHS systems.- Prioritize immigration queries for processing in the Law Enforcement Support Center using a risk-based assessment.- Provide an automated search and retrieval of immigration and criminal history data from multiple DHS and other US Government source systems.- Provide search results and other data used in status determinations to ICE agents, along with the capability for agents to conduct queries and create/amend status determinations.- Alignment with the ICE Enterprise Architecture and DHS Service Oriented Architecture models to address existing Immigration Alien Query (IAQ) functionality gaps, such as: limited workflow tracking of queries; manual researching of and copying/pasting of data from other DHS and FBI databases; limited information provided in query responses and requests for enforcement actions; and an inability to identify and track state and local law changes.- Decrease the overall time it takes to conduct subject threat assessments and to process IAQs, resulting in a decreased cost for each query or assessment.- Increase the % of criminal aliens identified, and subsequently increase the number of detainers placed upon them, while they are still in custody.","024-047 : Enforcement and Removal Operations","CAII was included in the DHS Joint Portfolio Review for FY13 and FY14, and there were no follow-up actions for FY14.  There were no follow-up actions for FY13 and the portfolio value score for FY13 is 0.512.  The architecture was expanded to incorporate functionality that would extend the processing of the Immigration Alien Responses (IAR) plus supporting history that are generated in response to Immigration Alien Queries (IAQ) from external law enforcement agencies.  ICE ERO Agents will receive the response history to determine further enforcement action.  If removal proceedings are to be pursued, the subject information is sent to the system in which ICE ERO Agents will continue with removal proceedings.  This will enable a seamless transition of information and process from the identification and determination of status through removal.   The CAII Solution Architecture was built prior to the target ICE EA reference models being overhauled.  The core architecture artifacts - the CAII Business Context Diagram (BCD), Business Service Diagrams (BSDs), and Process Component Model - have been reconciled with the current ICE EA BRM and SRM, and EA Roadmap.   There are numerous programmatic and technical innovations being implemented in CAII. Functionality is being developed in enterprise based applications and services, removing the co-located dependencies of legacy systems and enabling new functionality to be used by an exponentially larger community of users. Portions of CAII functionality will be provided by web services that can be called by other ICE and/or DHS systems, reducing the costs needed to develop similar in-application functionality. The deployment of the web-based NCIC search capability to the Law Enforcement Support Center can also be used by authorized personnel throughout ICE, removing their reliance upon limited-availability computer terminals to retrieve a subject's criminal history.","The CAII investment allows the continued support of key DHS and ICE missions of collecting law enforcement information, sharing the information, and providing agents with an analytic tool. The investment allows the expansion of information sharing among state, local, federal and international partners, thus complying with Presidential and Congressional mandates. The CAII projects will provide a flexible, scalable set of systems and services that easily allow for future enhancements and for additional data sets to be ingested. Even as the number of Immigration Alien Queries continues to increase, Law Enforcement Specialst productivity will be greatly increased through the use of the new systems, reflecting in cost avoidances as increased staffing will not be needed. Additionally, CAII will help provide greater accuracy and speed in the identification of criminal aliens, enabling law enforcement to detain them rather than release them back onto the streets.","The ACRIMe Modernization project deployed multiple releases that expanded the immigration alien query (IAQ) processing capability to process biographic-based queries, as well as No Match queries where subjects are foreign born but there are no immigration records. Iterative releases of the External Search Service were integrated into the ACRIMe Mod application, allowing law enforcement specialists to search multiple ICE, DHS, and other law enforcement systems from within ACRIMe, decreasing the time that specialists spend processing each IAQ. Functionality was deployed for ICE Agents to process immigration alien responses (IARs). The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Wants and Warrants Processing functionality was deployed, enabling specialists in the LESC to create, modify, validate, cancel and close ICE issued warrants and lookouts in the FBI's NCIC system. Functionality deployed in FY13 allows most of the LESC to move off of the legacy ACRIMe system to the modernized one.","In FY15, CAII will implement limited automated query processing and integration between the ACRIMe and Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) databases. That integration allows automated data sharing and reduces manual data entry. When that integration is completed, ACRIMe Field will be deployed to the ERO Command Centers and Areas of Responsibility (AOR).In FY16, CAII will be entirely in operations and maintenance.

Sequestration and other budget cuts necessitated the need to reduce FY13 expenditures. During FY13, the program was advised that it would be receiving $4M in AM funds in FY14. Since AM funds can only be spent on modernization or enhancements, certain O&M costs could not be replaced by the funding stream. Thus, there is an increase from the original FY14 budget submission.","A majority of the CAII contracts do not require EVM as they do not meet the minimum contract value threshold (as defined in the DHS Homeland Security Acquisition Manual, subchapter 3034.201) and/or the program manager's contract risk analysis.","3","The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Criminal Alien Identification Initiatives (CAII) program is in the Mixed life cycle phase.  A new program manager was assigned to CAII at the beginning of 2014.  While the program is operating within the OMB acceptable thresholds for cost variance, an overly aggressive development schedule in prior years resulted in a schedule variance beyond the acceptable range. Since the last assessment, the program has achieved full operational capability (FOC).  While full functionality of the Automated Threat Prioritization was achieved ahead of schedule, deployment of the Status Determination Support services was delayed, consequently breaching the FOC Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) milestone.  An APB Breach Memorandum and remediation plan were not submitted, but remediation was implemented and deployed as part of FOC.  Schedule delays were in part due to delayed customer feedback, work proving to be more complex than anticipated, and scope creep.  Corrective actions include updating the schedule with more realistic estimations of the work complexity, merging all contracts into a single O&M contract to align functional delivery going forward, and increasing cross-agency/cross-component communication.  The investment will be entering operations and maintenance (O&M) by FY2015.  There remain a number of interdependencies between external data sources.

The overarching recommendation resulting from the AoA is as follows: Develop a modernized IT infrastructure through a major overhaul of the database infrastructure and information assurance components, leveraging DHS Enterprise Services to the maximum extent possible and alternative services where necessary. The selected alternative, 'Leverage Enterprise Services' is modernizing the current IT network by migrating from a vendor serviced communications backbone to a DHS domain managed system.  This alternative includes a complete overhaul of the database, infrastructure and Information Assurance components as well as leveraging DHS Enterprise services to the maximum extent possible.  The network modernization contract, awarded in July 2014, includes the requirement to implement an architecture that is compliant with statutory and regulatory requirements as of the date of contract award, including Department of Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture and Federal Enterprise Architecture.  This contract includes a design that complies with the DHS Enterprise Architecture requirements and associated roadmap.  A description of the programmatic and / or technical innovation to be employed by the winning contractor is not yet available for public release.

Current priority voice capabilities are provided in circuit-switched networks through the Priority Telecommunications Services (PTS) Program including Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS), Wireless Priority Service(WPS) and Special Routing Arrangement Service(SRAS). Service providers are rapidly replacing their circuit-switched technologies with packet-switched technologies. This transition is underway and impacts all wireline and wireless services.  NGN addresses the emerging operational gap resulting from the technology transition. NGN goals are to ensure existing priority voice services are available over the evolving packet-switched infrastructure and to introduce priority versions of emerging communications services beyond voice (e.g. data and video). The NGN Program extends the services currently provided by PTS onto the packet-switched networks and allows the extension of functionality to video, and data. Benefits include Continuity of Government, Continuity of Operations, timely emergency response, and improved emergency response and recovery communications, which may result in lives and property saved.  Ability of national security personnel - from POTUS to First Responders--to communicate in times of crisis and congestion during natural or man-made events.NGN Priority Services will provide NS/EP priority voice services in the next generation networks of commercial service providers comparable to the services provided by the PTS Program. These services are used to facilitate essential Government services, coordinate response and recovery efforts, and assist with continuity of operations and continuity of government. As the NGN Program is able to address video and data services, the capability to share video and data will improve responsiveness and decision-making. The primary stakeholders for NGN are as follows: the President, Congress, DHS and DoD.  Key customers include all Federal Departments & Agencies, State, local, territorial & tribal governments & first responders. Beneficiaries include the American public by ensuring continuity of government communications and operations at the highest level of governance.","024-014 : Cybersecurity and Communications","Next Generation Network (NGN) Priority Services Program fully aligns with and supports the Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture (HLSEA).  NGN maintains alignment with the HLSEA and Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) reference models as demonstrated in the EA section and the Exhibit 53. NGN will be implemented wholly within the public/commercial telecommunication networks hence no service or capability is deployed within the DHS enterprise.  HLSEA target architecture and enterprise roadmap do not apply to the NGN Program because NGN does not implement any capabilities within the scope of the HLSEA.  Technical direction, target architectures, and roadmaps for the commercial service providers are determined independently by their respective organizations and the underlying technical standards upon which their networks are deployed.  NGN fully complies with the DHS Information Resources Management Strategic Plan FY14-18 and is reviewed annually by DHS CIO and updates are provided to IMS.   NGN does actively participate with industry standards development and road mapping to ensure NGN requirements are incorporated in the standards where appropriate.  Additionally, NGN engages the service provider community in the development of Government Industry Requirements (GIRs)  for priority services to assure technical innovation adequately addresses the needs of the NS/EP user community.     Currently the service providers are replacing their aging circuit-switched infrastructure with new packet-switched infrastructure.  GIRs for this evolution were developed and are being implemented within the commercial / public telecommunication infrastructure for the benefit of the National Security and Emergency Preparedness and public safety first responder user communities including the President, Congress, Federal, State, local, territorial, and tribal governments, industry partners and other authorized users.  By working closely with industry, the government is provided the most up to date innovations that are currently available and evolving in real-time.","NGN will be provided through service/performance-based contracts with commercial providers.  Given the greatest cash and benefit flows occur during an emergency event, projections are highly unpredictable and have large variances.  The current legacy Program, PTS, has been operational for over 20 years and the functional and performance requirements are not anticipated to change significantly.   There is no return on investment in the traditional financial sense, from a financial perspective.  However, the ability for continuous communications and coordination for continuity of government operations during times of crisis across all levels of government--Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial--as well as critical infrastructure industries and public safety first responders.  Furthermore, this constant communication and communication will help mitigate the reduction in loss of life and property.     Compliance with Executive Order (EO) 13618 is the qualitative justification for PTS.  EO 13618, Assignment of National Security and Emergency Preparedness Communications Functions, directs the Secretary of DHS to oversee the development, testing, implementation, and sustainment of NS/EP communications, including:  communications that support Continuity of Government; Federal, State, local, territorial, and tribal emergency preparedness and response communications; non-military executive branch communications systems; critical infrastructure protection networks- EO 13618 includes eight specific responsibilities for the Secretary of DHS, including provide NS/EP communications under all circumstances, ensure interoperability and ensure to the maximum extent practicable, the survivability of NS/EP communications.  The EO specifically identifies the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service, Wireless Priority Service, Telecommunications Service Priority program, and the Next Generation Network Priority Service program.  Benefits include Continuity of Government, Continuity of Operations, timely emergency response, and improved emergency response and recovery communications, which may result in lives and property saved.  Ability of national security personnel - from POTUS to First Responders - to communicate in times of crisis and congestion potentially preventing or mitigating terrorist or other attacks and increasing the likelihood of prevention and capture.","Achieved Acquisition Decision Event (ADE) 2B approval for NGN Phase 1 Increment 2 Wireless Access April 20, 2014.

It supports screening requirements of other Federal agencies. TECS interfaces with several law enforcement systems and federal agencies. TECS supports nearly 70,000 users representing over 20 Federal agencies responsible for traveler processing, investigations, vetting, entry/exit, and research. ICE has a separate but coordinated TECS Mod program. Each agency is modernizing and enhancing the parts of TECS that support their unique missions.CBP TECS Mod supports the CBP mission by enhancing the capability to protect the nation from the entry of dangerous or illegal people, ensuring efficient flow of lawful people crossing US borders and enabling effective decision making through improved intelligence and information sharing.TECS Mod has already reduced the possibility of missing someone who should have been intercepted by data integration and search capabilities; it is improving access to person-centric information by government officials; it has improved the effectiveness and efficiency of secondary inspections; it has incorporated new recognition capabilities; it responds to evolving threats.  TECS Mod has almost completed the replacement of dated technology that cannot be relied upon to support the CBP mission over the long term; it complies with CBP and DHS Service-Oriented Architecture; it allows person screening functions to be efficiently combined with other services to support end-to-end business processes.TECS Mod is benefitting by significantly reducing actual and projected costs of operational maintenance. It has increased the speed, reliability and accuracy of primary query responses. Report modules give managers increased visibility into field activities and the ability to supervise them.Key customers include DHS (CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA, Coast Guard, USCIS), DoJ (ATF, DEA, FBI) DoS (Visas, Passport Office, Bureau of Consular Affairs and Office of Diplomatic Security) DoT (IRS and Office of Foreign Assets Control), Department of Commerce, Department of Defense.  Stakeholders (and TECS Mod beneficiaries) are CBP Office of Field Operations, ICE, TSA, FBI, Secret Service, USCG, Dept. of Commerce, DoD, DoS and DoJ.  Other beneficiaries are CARICOM (Association of Caribbean Nations), Mexico, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Air Carriers, US domestic terminals and commercial ports of entry.","024-044 : Securing and Expediting Travel","TECS Mod contributes to the QHSR Mission 2: Secure and Manage Our Borders, as well as the DHS Screening Portfolio. TECS Modernization also aligns to CBP's Enterprise Technical Architecture 3.0 (ETA 3.0), the agency's target EA framework. The program uses the EA principle of architecting, designing and planning, and implementation to ensure the applications will work on the ETA 3.0 Common Delivery Platform (CDP), a vendor agnostic, standard based architecture and the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).  Using the ETA 3.0 framework will also ensure TECS Modernization business capabilities will conform to the agency's technology and security architecture, Department of Homeland Security IT Strategic Goals and be compliant with the Federal CIO 25 Point Program. TECS Modernization uses the agency targeted technology of CBP Cloud Computing Environment (C3E), an open-sourced storage, compute, network and operating system that prepares the application to comply with the Federal Cloud First policy.  This innovation ensures that TECS Mod applications are highly reliable, available and scalable for future growth.  C3E manageability reduces the total cost of ownership by reusing shared system components, sharing licenses and sharing operations and maintenance with other agency applications following ETA 3.0.  TECS Modernization will architect candidate services for external interfaces that will comply with service oriented architecture (SOA).  The developed services allow CBP internal and external stakeholders to collaborate and efficiently share information to meet their business mission needs.  TECS Modernization services will be highly interoperable and reusable to meet the agency's goal of building once and re-use as needed by subsequent applications thereby reducing the cost of future enhancements. TECS Modernization will architect and transition the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to the CBP Identity, Credentialing and Access Management (ICAM) security architecture when the agency's ICAM best practice and guidelines is released.  This ensures TECS Modernization will maintain secured access and system security while aligning to Federal government-wide common practices.","TECS Modernization's return on investment is 0.15.  This number was based on risk adjusted program costs over the life of the program of $538.591M into adjusted net benefits over the life of the program of $81.588 M.  The adjusted net benefits are the net present value and is the difference between the total discounted baseline of $620.179 M and the adjusted program costs.  The benefits are in the form of reduced costs for operational maintenance over the initial 14 year duration of the life cycle, especially in the final years as maintenance costs were expected to greatly exceed current costs as the system became increasingly difficult if not impossible to maintain.  Other benefits that could not be accurately quantified but were considered significant were the improvement of management reporting by which managers could extract information from operational databases that could significantly improve their ability to monitor and supervise TECS processes.  Increased efficiency, accuracy and reliability of responses to primary queries provide additional benefits to inspectors and to travelers.","Secondary Inspection: Land- ADE-3; SI enhancements implemented.High Performance Primary Query - APIS implemented.High Performance Primary Query - Primary Query Service Air Sea implemented.

IFT supports the United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Strategic Goals articulated in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) Report published by DHS in June 2014.    Benefits include mission efficiency and effectiveness, as well as Border Patrol safety. More specifically, the IFT system will provide the Border Patrol the capability of continuously detecting and identifying Items of Interest (IoIs) from at least a range of 5 miles from each fixed tower within a Border Patrol Station's Area of Coverage (AoC), and will provide the Common Operating Picture (COP) operator(s) at the Border Patrol Station Command and Control Center with near real-time video of operator-selected IoIs of sufficient quality to enable a trained operator to identify and classify the IoI.  IoI data from one or more IFT units across the AoC will be shown geospatially on one or more COP workstations that also display the video of operator-selected IoIs. This will allow the COP operator to track and communicate the location and number of IoIs to Border Patrol Agents in the field, thus allowing the USBP to monitor an Area of Interest (AoI) with fewer agents and equipment resources.  The IFT program supports Mission 2 of the QHSR: Secure and Manage our Borders.  More specifically, the IFT Program addresses Goal 2.1: Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, and preventing the illegal entry of people, weapons, dangerous goods, and contraband, and protect against cross-border threats to health, food, environment, and agriculture, while facilitating the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce, as well as prevent the illegal export of weapons, proceeds of crime, and other dangerous goods, and the exit of malicious actors.

Key Beneficiaries: Citizens of the United States of America, The U.S. Border Patrol.","024-042 : Securing America's Borders","IFT will enhance situational awareness by deploying sensor suites at fixed, elevated sites to provide automated persistent detection, identification, and classification capabilities between ports of entry.  As such, the IFT investment supports the QHSR Mission 2 - Securing and Managing Our Borders and also contributes to the DHS target EA as part of the DHS Domain Awareness portfolio (subsection 4.6 in the DHS Enterprise Roadmap) and the Integrated Domain Awareness Segment Architecture (subsection 5.2 of the DHS Enterprise Roadmap).   The IFT Program has been designated as a Mixed Information Technology (IT)/non-IT, Level 1 acquisition program. As a result, the CBP OIT is a joint primary stakeholder. Since IFT has an IT component, the applicable DHS IT system C&A policies and procedures are imposed. All IFT IT & non-IT components are part of an NDI procurement. IFT will be a single stand-alone system, and a single item on the CBP EA Technology Reference Model (TRM) with restricted status. However, all IFT IT components (HW & SW) will be subject to the CBP Technical Insertion (TI) and TRM review process. The IFT team will work with CBP OIT Technology Directorate (TD) team, who manage the TI/TRM process, after Contract Award protest resolution to support the System Level TI process request accordingly. The TI process ensures that the IFT architecture and HW/SW products align with DHS and CBP Technical and Business reference models and capabilities.  The IFT Program follows the guidelines set forth in the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Framework (FEAF). The FEAF focuses on the comprehensive business-driven aspects to support and satisfy CBP EA requirements. The IFT program has and will support required OIT Enterprise Architecture Branch (EAB) AAA reviews. Through this process the IFT program will maintain its alignment with CBP and DHS EA. During the combined Stage 1/2, documents for the System Requirements Review (SRR) and the System Definition Review (SDR) were submitted to EAB for AAA-2. As this combined stage includes the Source Selection for the IFT Program, representatives of the OIT were involved in the Source Selection process to provide coordination pursuant to the AAA process. As specified in the SELC TP, documents for AAA-3 will be submitted and OIT EAB review requested after deployment in the first AoR.","Compared to the baseline operating costs from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the operating costs for IFT system are estimated to be considerably lower (358.3M vs. 2,104.1M). ROI was calculated by (Operating Costs without IFT - Operating Costs with IFT) divided by the Capital Investment costs, providing the same level of surveillance.  Ergo, the key benefit is that for a lower overall operating cost , the IFT system will provide the Border Patrol with a persistent surveillance capability, which will enable them to detect, identify, and track IoIs, thus enabling them to monitor an Area of Interest more efficiently and effectively. Other benefits include: it facilitates mission accomplishment; it allows agents to be realigned since it acts as a force multiplier; agents will be safer since fewer will be needed in the field for surveillance; it will be used only in areas in which it performs well; and improved data will be available (e.g., recorded video) for successful law enforcement accomplishment versus the baseline.","The IFT contract was awarded on 2/26/14, starting the Nogales (NGL) Station AOR deployment.

The NB RVSS program will be expanding coverage for BY16 by adding 3 sensor sites in Swanton, VT and 1 additional sensor site in Detroit, MI. The NB RVSS system enhances surveillance capability by providing situational awareness of border activity through persistent surveillance and detection to facilitate proper law enforcement resolution.  The NB RVSS towers have expanded the coverage on the northern border where highly trafficked and illegal activities exist.The NB RVSS supports the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review by specifically supporting the security mission to Secure and Manage Our Borders. The NB RVSS systems support the DHS mission to improve upon border security, to exclude terrorist threats, drug traffickers, and other threats to national security, economic security, and public safety. The goal of the NB RVSS project is to provide persistent ground and maritime surveillance needed by Border Patrol agents to effectively deter, detect, track, identify, classify, and respond to items of interest throughout the respective Area of Responsibility (AOR). The deployed system covers over 50 miles of maritime border with the RVSS capability. Operating and maintaining the NB RVSS towers provides the financial savings of not having to commit hundreds of agents to support the mission. The deployed systems serve as force multipliers enabling CBP officers to effectively monitor the vast and complex border.  The key customer and primary stakeholder of this capability is the Office of Border Patrol (OBP); other beneficiaries are the Office of Field Operations (OFO), Office of Air and Marine (OAM), Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison (OIIL), and US Coast Guard (USCG). The NB-RVSS's ROI has achieved several quantitative benefits that are internal and external to the government: 1. Approximately 59 miles of surveillance coverage along the northern border: 37 miles of coverage along St. Clair River, 15 miles of coverage along the upper Niagara River, and 7 miles of surveillance coverage with the 12th RVSS tower at Grosse Pointe. 2. Increased situational awareness through the deployment of RVSS in the northern border. 3.

There are approximately 50 miles of surveillance coverage in the northern border with this investment. 2. The investment provides increased situational awareness through the deployment of RVSS in the northern border. 3. The system is available for use and operating dependably 99% of the time.To further define the basis for the ROI, an ROI document was developed and available upon request. Based on a value of 2,200 Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) and 4,000 miles of border there are an average of 0.55 agents per mile of border.  Note that not all of these agents are on the border providing surveillance.  They perform a variety of tasks. For the Base Case, we are assuming that persistent surveillance (i.e., 24 hours per day and 365 days per year) is required and consists of 0.55 agents per mile of border.  The value of 0.55 agents per mile as an average was selected even though multiple shifts are required and not all current agents provide surveillance support at all times.  That is, this section of the border is assumed to be more active and require more agents than the average stretch of border.  The border is assumed to be limited to the section along which the Northern Border RVSS project would operate (i.e., 50 miles).  One truck is assumed to be provided per every four agents for transportation to and from the Border Patrol Stations (BPSs).  An average round trip travel distance for each truck was assumed to be 80 miles per shift with 3 shifts per day.  Note that at 3 shifts per day including weekends requires 4.2 x 0.55 agents per mile for persistent coverage. The cost development and comparison of the Base Case versus the Alternative is provided in the tables in the ROI document.

Block 1 technology supports USBP agents to effectively detect, identify, classify and resolve illegal incursions at the border. Block 1 includes a deployment of towers with a suite of integrated day and night cameras, radars, unattended ground sensors and a communications package. Block 1 also includes a common operating picture (COP) that integrates the sensors and displays the results at a command center. Block 1 deployments in Tucson Sector collectively cover approximately 53 miles of international border in Arizona and remain the only deployments of the Block 1 system. In addition, the Block 1 system provides numerous operational benefits such as improved situational awareness, which has increased USBP's ability to execute its mission elements and processes. These elements/processes include: predict, deter, detect, identify, classify, track, respond, and resolve. The system integrates sensor outputs into a COP that gives USBP persistent coverage within the Block 1 sensor viewsheds and more opportunities for early identification and classification. A viewshed as defined by the Office of Technology Innovation & Acquisition (OTIA) Systems Engineering Directorate describes the line of sight from the observer position (sensor tower) to a point on the ground (target) from both a visual and a radar perspective. It offers potential ranges of visibility coverage to a target from a fixed tower position. The Block 1 system provides improved safety benefits to USBP with better tactical advantages through: over watch capabilities which use geo-positioning information with visual verification of agent locations relative to threats; better geo-synchronization actions for risk reduction through the use of landmarks and terrain references on the COP; geo-spatial tracking; visual verification; real time information on specific threats; and increased visual coverage through the use of sensors. The primary Block 1 stakeholder is the USBP and USBP is the key customer of the Block 1 system. The Office of Field Operations and the Office of Air & Marine are operational stakeholders. The primary beneficiaries are US citizens that own land on the border and citizens that frequent the national parks within the Tucson sector.","024-042 : Securing America's Borders","The Block 1 investment enables effective manpower allocation along the Southwest Border by maintaining continuity of operations of the persistent surveillance capability.  As such, the Block 1 investment contributes to DHS's target EA because it is part of the DHS Domain Awareness portfolio (subsection 4.6 in the DHS Enterprise Roadmap) and the Integrated Domain Awareness Segment Architecture (subsection 5.2 of the DHS Enterprise Roadmap). It also supports the QHSR Mission 2: Secure and Manage Our Borders. The Block 1 Program Office has focused on programmatic innovations in order to reduce annual sustainment costs while at the same time not negatively impacting operational availability (Ao) of the system. Leveraging existing facilities such as the Primary Support Facility (PSF) in Tucson is one such example where cost sharing opportunities exist with other programs leveraging the same facility and reducing Block 1 Program's share of the cost. Similar cost sharing arrangements have been achieved at the AJO Border Patrol Station where multiple technologies are supported or will be deployed in the near future - Block 1, RVSS, and IFT. The role that the Southwest Field Office (SWFO) has played has evolved and matured as the eyes and ears on the ground for the OTIA PMO in Arizona. Technical innovations are all sustainment focused, such as extending grid power to 4 towers in TUS-1 to achieve cost savings on propane deliveries as demonstrated by the cost savings realized on the AJO-1 towers on grid power since 2012.","A traditional return on investment calculation for Block 1 is difficult to quantify given there is no means to measure return in terms of dollars for a system that produces increased situational awareness for USBP that results in increased apprehensions and drug seizures along the 53 mile section of the Arizona border with Mexico. Moreover, prior to the Block 1 system deployment, USBP did not possess a capability to accurately determine the amount of illegal traffic in the area currently covered by the Block 1 system. Without a prior baseline capability to compare the Block 1 system to, the ROI calculation is limited in its value to show benefits of the system. The ROI calculation shows -90% for the expected useful life of the Block 1 system. The Block 1 system will never recover the initial investment from Secure Border Initiative Program (SBInet) in dollar terms; however, there are several significant benefits that have been realized and can be qualified in terms of mission assurance for USBP and benefits to society. The internal benefit of improved situational awareness on the Arizona border has increased USBP's ability to execute its mission elements and processes. These elements/processes include: predict, deter, detect, identify, classify, track, respond, and resolve. The Block 1 system integrates multiple sensor outputs into one COP and provides USBP with persistent coverage within the Block 1 sensor viewsheds (see definition - Q. 9). In addition, these sensors are able to provide USBP Agents with an increased visual coverage area and more opportunities for early identification and classification. Another internal benefit includes improving officer safety via providing BP with tactical advantages. The Block 1 system is able to provide the Border Patrol with better tactical advantages through: over watch capabilities which use geo-positioning information with visual verification of Agent locations relative to threats; better geo-synchronization actions for risk reduction through the use of landmarks and terrain references on the COP; geo-spatial tracking; visual verification; real time information on specific threats; and increased visual coverage through the use of sensors. Benefits external to the government include landowners within the Block 1 system coverage that have fewer claims from damaged fences and overall fewer property thefts. This also applies to citizen use of national wildlife refuges within the Block 1 system.","The operational availability of the system for PY 2014 remained above the objective of 95% and operational performance met all targets. No deployments outside of those currently in Tucson and Ajo are authorized or planned. Accomplishments for PY 2014 include: successful transition from contractor maintenance logistics support (CMLS) provided by the Boeing Company to organic Government sustainment, successful transition of NOC/SOC maintenance, successful transition of Organizational-Level (O-Level) maintenance, successful transition of site-level maintenance, and successful transition of the Primary Support Facility (PSF) lease in Tucson, AZ.","The Block 1 objectives for CY2015 remain to meet the operational performance objectives for Operational Availability (Ao) of 95%, in addition to meeting all operational performance objectives for the investment.  The focus on successful transition of logistics elements from CMLS to organic Government sustainment will focus on cost reduction without impacting operational availability of the system. The Program Office will look for more cost sharing opportunities in the CY and BY similar to the PSF lease share with MSS as an example of more ways to share costs with other programs and reduce the total sustainment costs on an annual basis. The objective for the budget out years is a decision on the future of the Block 1 system in terms of a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) currently planned for FY 2018. Based on the analysis of remaining useful life of sensor components on the Block 1 towers, and supportability of the C2 software, a joint decision between OTIA and USBP will be made early enough to provide enough time to not negatively impact the day to day operations of the TUS and AJO AORs.","no","yes","no","no","no","no","no","no","Not applicable for the Block 1 investment has no DME funding provided.","no","61.135000","22.704000","15.681000","17.263000","2011","2020","The funding levels for PY 2014, CY 215, and the final FY 2015 President's Budget did not involve any significant changes.

The MSC is an integrated suite of sensor equipment attached to the flat skid cargo bed of a Government-furnished Ford F-450 truck, with an operator workstation located inside the truck cabin. The purpose of the MSC is to provide mobile area surveillance in remote rural areas over a range of 8 to 12 kilometers.  This allows CBP to adjust the location of its surveillance capabilities to keep pace with the ever changing border threat. The MSC goals are to increase the situational awareness of CBP by detecting, identifying, tracking, and classifying potential items of interest.  These goals support CBP mission goals and priorities: Mission 1 - Securing America's Borders; Goal 1.1 - Secure the Southwest Border, as well as the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Goal - Secure and Manage our Borders.Several benefits of the MSC are as follows: 1) Allows for the identification and tracking of numerous IOI's over a large area, the MSC allows for greater surveillance coverage then possible with an agent on foot.  2) Enhances BP Agent safety by providing advanced warning of not only the existence of IOI's but the nature of that threat including whether the individuals are armed. 3) The abilities of the MSC also allow for greater response coordination thereby improving the likelihood of a successful law enforcement resolution as well as officer safety. Radar capabilities provide two significant benefits over a camera only system: advanced warning of the existence of IOIs, and can allow for tracking of numerous IOI's over a larger area.The key customers, stakeholders, and other beneficiaries of the MSC system are US Border Patrol agents. Border Patrol Agents currently rely on legacy capabilities such as sign cutting, which are time tested and proven, but place agents at high risk in difficult locations. By detecting and identifying the threat from a safe distance, agents are able to determine the time, method, and location of an interdiction.  This capability gives agents a pivotal operational advantage. Surveillance technology is able to identify threats early, before an agent must close for an arrest. The long range ability of this technology provides more time for agents to prepare for the threat.","024-042 : Securing America's Borders","The MSC investment enables effective manpower allocation along the Southwest Border by augmenting fixed tower surveillance infrastructure with the ability to move surveillance assets based on threat behavior and extend reach to remote locations.As such, the MSC investment contributes to DHS's target EA because it is part of the DHS Domain Awareness portfolio (subsection 4.6 in the DHS Enterprise Roadmap) and the Integrated Domain Awareness Segment Architecture (subsection 5.2 of the DHS Enterprise Roadmap). It also supports the QHSR Mission 2: Secure and Manage Our Borders.The MSC investment has several technical innovations. The MSC has improved sensors and the design of the MSC have improved utility of the system for Agents. The MSC radar has greater range, lower mean detectable velocity  and a faster scan rate. The electro-optical infrared (EOIR) camera is integrated into a gimbaled turret which improves the ability to maintain the calibration of systems including camera and system alignment which vastly improves the utility of the laser pointer (designator). The turret also improves the EOIR image clarity through gyro-stabilization. In addition, the EO camera can be used for local situational awareness around the which provides great agent situational awareness and safety. The MSC system was designed with ease of set-up and has proven to have improved reliability when moved which makes the system truly mobile and operationally flexible.","A traditional return on investment calculation is difficult to quantify given there is no means to measure return in terms of dollars for a system that produces increased situational awareness for the Office of Border Patrol (OBP) that results in increased apprehensions and drug seizures. Nonetheless, an ROI calculation was developed based on operating assumptions. There is a high cost for the status quo, and the MSC system requires a relatively low capital investment, resulting in a high ROI. Note - The ROI is 3614 % but the form does not allow a number above 999%, so I truncated the first digit and 3614 became 614. The purpose of the investment is to increase the probability of apprehension in an effort to reduce cross border crime. Internal benefits are the increased probability of detection which increases the costs of attempting to enter the U.S. illegally, thereby reducing the illicit flows and crimes associated with smuggling at and between the ports of entry in Arizona.  United States Border Protection (USBP) requires persistent surveillance capabilities giving agents the ability to detect, identify, classify, and track illegal entries into the U.S. U.S. border threats are opportunistic, adaptive and continuously probing to exploit any new or existing weaknesses observed, and they have near real-time situational awareness of USBP activities through the use of a vast network of scouts on both sides of the border. For some locations, MSC systems are more effective systems than fixed tower infrastructure. MSC systems, with their mobile capabilities, can respond to threats in multiple areas, and can be fielded in the areas with the highest threats.  A more mobile response capability allows more flexibility and the ability to adjust to changes in IOI patterns. MSC systems can be used to augment existing systems or substitute for currently deployed technology temporarily non-operational. By allowing for the identification and tracking of numerous IOI's over a large area, the MSC serves as a force multiplier and provides greater surveillance coverage then possible by an agent on foot. External benefits include benefits related to the deterrence effect of a deployed MSC. The presence of an MSC can provide sufficient deterrence that IOIs choose alternative border crossings and therefore there are lower impacts in the local area where the MSC is deployed, thereby mitigating impacts in these area from impacts generated by the illicit cross border violators.","The second First Article Test (FAT) for ICx was completed in July 2012 and after improvements were made the Government conditionally accepted the ICx FAT units on July 13, 2012.  Once fix plans were completed the Government approved a final production decision for ICx on September 27th, 2012. ICx delivered Train the Trainer (T3) Material in February 2013 as well as the vendor integrated logistics support plan. The first production lot of 6 units was delivered in March 2013. In April 2013, the T3 Course was held and 4 MSC units were delivered. The remaining 23 MSC units were delivered in May 2013 (10 units) and June 2013 (13 units). The vendor maintenance training, operations and maintenance manuals, and technical product drawings were delivered in July 2013.  Sixteen additional MSC units were ordered in December 2013 for delivery by October 2014.  The contract option to extend vendor maintenance for 12 additional months was exercised in April 2014.","Planned accomplishments for FY 2015 include continued operations and maintenance of the 49 deployed MSC units (33 current units currently deployed and 16 new units that will be deployed by first quarter FY 2015).  The investment plans on completing an Operational Analysis in FY 2015 and every year thereafter.  During FY 2015, the investment will begin executing a transition plan to continue sustainment after the current Contractor Maintenance and Logistics Support (CMLS) contract ends in December 2015.  In the out years the program will continue to operate and maintain the MSC units.  In FY 19, a technology refresh is planned, five years after initial deployments of the MSC.Additionally, CBP received a funding increase for BY16 through FYHSP based on the results of the OMB Passback. This funding will allow CBP to procure a minimum of 10 additional MSC systems, including initial spares and program support, for deployment to the El Paso, Big Bend, and Del Rio Sectors. The proposed increase will benefit CBP operations on the Southwest border.

This investment supports the DHS mission and DHS Strategic Plan, FY12-16 Goal: Enhance Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Integrated Operations: Institute optimal mechanisms to integrate the Department's intelligence elements, increase operational capability and harmonize operations is achieved. Stakeholders include DHS Components, other Government Agencies, Federal, State, Local, Municipal government, and Tribal Partners. Customers include government employees and contractors, external customer such as those individuals requesting naturalization or citizenship services, foreign students and exchange visitors, and permanent and temporary workers and trusted partners. The goal is to establish a contained cybersecurity posture, create a shared services model consolidating investment and integrating technology.  Benefits include the creation of a trusted identity system of integrated capabilities and supporting infrastructure, end users and computer systems that authenticate themselves (verify their identity) against  trusted authenticating authorities at an Enterprise-level. DHS also benefits by increased IT security, reduced data breaches, insider threat mitigation and trust violations. Security gaps are closed related to user identification and authentication, access control, encryption of sensitive data, and logging and auditing.  Personally Identifiable Information (PII) protection is increased by consolidating, searching, locating and securing identity data, improving access controls, encryption, and automating provisioning and deprovisioning processes.  Interoperability improves between agencies using their Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials and partners carrying PIV-interoperable or third party credentials, and the number of credentials are minimized.  An ICAM Shared Services Model facilitates secure, streamlined, and user-friendly transactions translating into improved customer service, lower help desk costs, and increased consumer confidence in agency services.  Customers benefit as a result of implementation of more efficient processes to validate and authenticate identities which in turn will help expedite service requests.","024-003 : Under Secretary for Management","ICAM comprises the programs, processes, technologies, and personnel used to create trusted digital identity representations of individuals and Non-Person Entities (NPEs), bind those identities to credentials that may serve as a proxy for the individual or NPE in access transactions, and leverage the credentials to provide authorized access to an agency's resources.The ICAM Segment Architecture is consistent with the Federal ICAM (FICAM) and maps FICAM Services and Use cases to the DHS mission. As funding becomes available for the ICAM Investment a target ICAM Solution Architecture will be developed as part of the DHS transition and To-Be environments. ICAM has been identified within the DHS PortfolioStat Plan incorporated into a DHS-level Shared Service and Delivery model, and will be incorporated into the DHS Commodity IT Consolidation Plan (as part of the DHS Enterprise Roadmap). The investment creates an Enterprise ICAM Governance structure effecting a unified ICAM strategy across the Department for strategic alignment; value delivery of the ICAM services; and performance, resources and risk management at an Enterprise-level.Initiatives support IT Strategic goals included in the Enterprise-level and the Information Resources Management (IRM) Strategic Plan: FY2014-2018. Implementing Mandatory PIV for logical access to the DHS unclassified networks is ongoing and will implement of centralized LACS capability for internal and external users (includes federation). One path toward implementing technical innovation is the business case submitted for FY16 - Enterprise Resource Allocation Planning (RAP) funding for a Single Sign-On (SSO) and Trusted Identity Exchange (TIE) solution. SSO - Enables DHS users, trusted partners, and the public to use preferred credentials, that are interoperable, privacy enhancing, secure, and easy to use, to log on to applications without being asked for a password and/or PIN each time they attempt to access data.Trusted Identity Exchange (TIE) - The TIE is the basic building block for SSO as it creates a single, authoritative view of people that logon to DHS applications. The TIE will provide characteristics about people (attributes) to enable decisions for who should be able to see which information. TIE is a foundational element in the construction of the DHS Data Framework and is required in accordance with the DHS Information Sharing and Policy Framework (ISAPF).","Overall return on investment includes internal and external benefits such as:* Increased protection of personally identifiable information (PII) by securing authentication credential, which is accomplished by eliminating use of username and password for network authentication.* Compliance with laws, regulations, and standards as well as resolution of issues highlighted in GAO reports of DHS progress. * Increased security, which correlates directly to reduction in identity theft, data breaches, and trust violations. Specifically, this initiative closes security gaps in the areas of user identification and authentication, logging and auditing. * Elimination of redundancy, both through DHS consolidation of processes and workflow and the provision of government-wide services to support ICAM processes. This results in extensibility of the IT enterprise and reduction in the overall cost of security infrastructure, training and communication. * Enhanced customer service, both within DHS components and with business partners and constituents. Facilitating secure, streamlined, and user-friendly transactions - including information sharing - translates directly into improved customer service scores, lower help desk costs, and increased consumer confidence in DHS services. Improved interoperability, specifically between agencies using PIV credentials along with other partners carrying PIV-interoperable or third party credentials that meet the requirements of the federal trust framework. Additional benefits include minimizing the number of credentials requiring lifecycle management.Decreased Number of Credentials - Decreased Number of Credentials Per Network End-Users. Investment ROI is currently 0.0 - FY14 and FY15 is O&M enterprise support for Mandatory PIV enablement. FY16 - Single Sign-on (SSO) and Trusted Identity Exchange (TIE) enterprise services will be in planning/development - will require an adjustment to investment ROI after AoA and CBA are completed. The SSO and TIE efforts have an initial estimated cost savings of $114,352,000 over a 5 year period.Access Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a new initiative funded initially in FY14.

The primary goal for the FPS Land Mobile Radio (LMR) communications system is to have instantaneous communications capability with the Primary stakeholder:  The Federal Protective Service and all of its Federal Law Enforcement officers to include senior leadership responsible for carrying out the FPS mission of security and protecting Federal buildings and property. The 13,000 plus Protective Security Officers assigned to the perimeter of all Federal Buildings and property. The General Services Administration Office of Inspector General and GSA maintenance staff all which use the FPS radio network and the 4 FPS MegaCenters located in Denver, Philadelphia, Battle Creek and Suitland which are directly responsible for dispatching all the FPS LEO's and the PSO's.  And all Federal and contract employees that work daily in the Federal buildings across the US. The Indirect stakeholders are the over 1 million visitors that enter Federal buildings daily across the US, all the American Veteran's that use the health care services, all the American's that use the Social Security Administration, other DHS Federal Agencies that use the FPS radio network for interoperability, FEMA for all national disasters, Buckley Air force base in Colorado, all Federal and contract employees using property and or services of the Federal Government. State and local Law Enforcement Agencies for interoperability in national events, such as Democratic and Republican conventions, G8 summits, national protests, Presidential Inaugurations, natural disasters (i.e. Hurricane Sandy), the Boston Bombing and other terrorists attacks.  A secondary goal is to have a centralized contact number for the stakeholders, customers, visitors and employees to contact when the presence of an FPS Law Enforcement Officer (FPS LEO) is needed to preserve the peace and to investigate suspicious or criminal activity.  By having an adequate and dependable LMR communications capability FPS ensures our stakeholders, customers, visitors and employees that a FPS LEO will be available to respond and to protect them from harm.  It is incumbent on FPS to ensure the system does not experience a catastrophic failure to ensure the welfare of the LEO's and the public we serve.","024-012 : Federal Protective Service","The DHS TACCOM investment was included in the 2012 DHS Enterprise IT Services Portfolio Review.  Specific recommendation were not given for investments in the Enterprise IT Services Portfolio.  TACCOM will provide direct support to DHS Mission #2:  Securing and Managing our borders.  This O&M effort is sustainment of the existing FPS legacy LMR network. However; it is a vital link to FPS's roles and responsibilities which tie directly to the DHS goals mission of PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY and the protection of Federal Buildings and is one of the major enablers to ensure FPS can carry out its mission. Without the FPS LMR network and its capabilities FPS's day to day operations would be severely limited and would compromise safety of millions of people that work, use these services and visit Federal Facilities each day. Since this is only a sustainment effort, the programmatic or technical innovations are limited by the fact that this is a legacy system, however, this effort is very similar to the other LMR systems within all the other DHS Law Enforcement agencies. Innovation aligns with the DHS Joint Wireless Program Office (JWPMO) and its future goals as well as technology advancement and technical innovations/solutions. The future goal of all existing LMR systems is to migrate to a broadband solution which will provide an overarching state of the art solution for all of DHS communication needs. This is a very large, complex and costly effort and FPS is a working member of all the JWPMO working groups to ensure as a solution is designed and funded to meet the needs of FPS which will be addressed as the other Federal LEO agencies are addressed in a future overall JWPMO radio network. This FPS sustainment effort is in line with the direction of the JWPMO and other working groups as a complete solution is very likely to be many years out. All Federal agencies that depend on LMR are being directed by the JWPMO working group, as well as others, to position themselves to maintain all existing LMR system until such time as a consolidated solution at the Federal Government Radio Communications Department level solution is designed, funded and implemented.","FPS remains a non-Congressionally funded agency that receives its current limited funding via reimbursable through the security fees associated with all GSA owned or leased buildings.  This effort remains in a sustainment state as no investment dollars are identified within FPS's budget.   However, should funding be identified for future investment, FPS plans to submit new projects related to these investment dollars.This O&M effort provides tremendous benefit to the government, general public as well as internal FPS officers, external stake holders and other departments within DHS.  Benefits and or returns are ensuring the health and safety aspect of all that enter government facilities by, use any of the Government facilities and or services by enabling real time dispatch and response services to over 9000 Federal buildings nationwide.  These dispatch and response services serve as a direct tool to carry out law enforcement and emergency services.  Without these services, it would jeopardize the safety and well-being of visitors and employees, both contract and Federal within the more than 9000 Federal buildings.  This also enables FPS to provide a police force that provides a proactive patrol focus in and around Government facilities.  It also enables FPS to perform its mission linked directly to DHS's goal of securing boarders and protecting against terrorism.  In order for FPS to complete the aforementioned mission, radio communication is imperative as a primary line of support for over 1000 Law Enforcement Officers and 13000 Protective Security Officers.  Without this continued O & M effort, national radio circuits would not be repaired, mobile and portable radios would not be serviced, antenna sites would not be maintained, new frequencies would not be programmed into the radios, a national code-plug would not be maintained and the entire infrastructure would fall into a state of disrepair.","The baseline goals and targets have been exceeded in FY13 and FY14, this investment is tracked using 5 performance measure. The data use for 3 of these performance measures (item 1,3 and 5) are collected and calculated by each of the 4 MegaCenters which represent the result of these performance measures on a National Level which includes the entire geographical coverage of FPS. The date used for the remaining 2 performance measures (2 and 4) are collected by the O&M effort itself and are tracked using the service tickets created by the contract on all radio outages and repairs Nationally. The results of 3 performance measure  tracked by the MegaCenters and the 2 performance measures directly tracked  from the O&M contract are electronically calculated which produces the results shown in the Operational Performance section of the OMB 300.","The objective of this investment is sustainment of the National FPS radio communication network.

As stated within the NFIP ITSS business case, the goals of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) itself are threefold: to identify and map areas of flood risk, to protect communities from potential flood damage through floodplain management, and to provide flood insurance. The current benefit of this investment is to provide support for the Write Your Own insurance companies (WYOs), the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA), and Vendors (a group of flood insurance processing services providers to the WYOs).  As policy maker and program administrator, the NFIP plays a crucial role in gathering information from insurance companies that sell the product and in the provision of financial management, analysis, reporting and oversight. The specific benefits and functions of the NFIP include the establishment of operating policies, designation of eligible communities, creation of auditing specifications,  experience determination,  rate setting,  responsibility for the management, operation, maintenance and quality assurance of the systems and data, marketing, training provision, analysis and reporting to Congress, and provision of financial information to all applicable departments and agencies.  The Bureau and Statistical Agent (BSA) for the NFIP supplies information aggregation to the NFIP, thereby providing analytical and actuarial analyses (including the identification and solution of problems) and the development of forms, manuals and other materials. NFIP stakeholders include FIMA, the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA), Write Your Own insurance companies (WYOs), Flood Insurance Processing Services Providers to WYOs (Vendors), adjusters, IBHS Flood Committee, Flood Zone Determination companies, and Service Providers to FIMA (Contractors). The customers and beneficiaries are US citizen flood insurance policy holders.","024-005 : Mitigation","The Phoenix Program is currently early in the DHS Lifecycle NEED Phase (Pre-ADE-1,Pre-SPR in the SELC).   Phoenix will be developed in complete compliance with the Enterprise Architecture Review Board Processes.  Programmatic and technical innovations will occur in the 4 business process areas of Underwriting, Claims, Actuarial and Financial Management.  An improved Underwriting process will provide user friendly and information rich point of sale capability between policy holder and agent or lender, including enhanced access to required information, a user friendly sales process for agents, lenders, and customers,  joint review by Underwriting and Claims enabled by information technology, and updated rate tables, available on the web for use by the WYO agents.  An improved Claims process will provide technologically enhanced claims error checking capability,  i.e., an early warning system that identifies claims related errors at the source in order to reduce later error/reconciliation processes, and on-line capability for WYOs to view their specific claims and underwriting data.  An improved Actuarial process will be enabled by significantly more powerful and cross cutting analytical capabilities which will be a primary contributor to the development of front-end policy growth strategies to include continuance as the focal point for Program data integrity and analysis.  In this latter role, it serves as the provider of analysis services for the other Directorates. This enhanced actuarial process will also include a focus on data accuracy and the management of data, development and testing of sales strategies and market segmentation activities in cooperation with the Marketing Directorate, support for traditional actuarial functions, minimizing total Program cost along the entire value chain, i.e., from policy holder to FIMA headquarters, current analytical capabilities and tools will be expanded and enhanced to allow for improved ad-hoc and standard analysis (and decision making) and finally capability for customized analysis of risk factors and possible business scenarios at FIMA.  An improved Financial Management process will provide enhancements in data timeliness and quality.  Additional non-quantifiable innovations will include real time access to data, standardization of data/data quality, better analytical tools, financially sound program strategy, and improved interoperability.","The Phoenix Program is currently early in the DHS Lifecycle NEED Phase (Pre-ADE-1,Pre-SPR in the SELC).

Under this program, DHS will centrally oversee the procurement and operations of diagnostic sensors (tools) and dashboards deployed to each participating agency. Using input from the sensors and agency-level dashboards, officials at each agency will be able to quickly identify which network problems to fix first, and empower technical managers to prioritize and mitigate risks on their respective networks. In addition, DHS will maintain a dashboard to provide situational awareness on a federal level. The GSA CDM blanket purchase agreement offers Continuous Monitoring as a Service (CMaaS) to support CDM tool procurement, integration and agency customization services. This initiative directly responds to key pieces of policy guidance for DHS and its role in federal network security. First, it supports DHS Mission Four, Safeguarding and Securing Cyberspace. Secondly, it is in direct support of the Administration's 2014/15 Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal for implementing continuous monitoring across the federal network space. It supports OMB-10-28 which mandates DHS to provide support to government-wide and agency-specific efforts to provide adequate, risk-based and cost-effective cybersecurity. It is a key element in OMB-14-03, Enhancing the Security of Federal Information and Information Systems, which provides guidance for managing information security risk and requires agencies to migrate to the GSA BPA as contract terms expire for acquisition vehicles currently used to acquire information security products and services.This program will address the following mission operations capabilities:Improve the security posture of federal .gov networks;Improve the effectiveness by which federal networks are secured;Build maturity into the continuous monitoring/diagnostics program across the federal enterprise;Fix the worst items first, allowing real-time prioritization of remediation activities.Key customers/beneficiaries include the federal civilian agencies, OMB, NSC, and defense and state, local, tribal and territorial government entities. In addition, DHS NCCIC will be able to use the information to further inform its analysis of the dot gov network security.","024-014 : Cybersecurity and Communications","From its inception, the CDM program decided, in the interest of efficiency, expediency, and effectiveness, to pursue commercial best fit in acquiring necessary tools for continuous diagnostics and mitigation. To that end, the CDM program is leveraging the architecture developed by the Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational Awareness and Risk Scoring (CAESARS), developed by DHS FNS in collaboration and consultation with the U.S. Chief Information Officer Council's Information Security and Identity Management Subcommittee on Continuous Monitoring. Given the program's focus on providing capabilities to other departments/agencies, it will follow the Federal EA framework. The DHS-specific EA framework is applicable to the CDM Federal Dashboard, which will be operated by DHS.The program's commercial best fit approach aligns with federal procurement practices to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products whenever possible (FAR subpart 12.1), and allows the program to share some of the technical risk with the vendor. In addition, Title 44 USC section 3541 acknowledges that commercially developed information security products offer advanced, dynamic, robust and effective information security solutions, reflecting market solutions for the protection of critical information infrastructures-CDM's procurement approach is as innovative as its technology approach. The program partnered with GSA to develop a blanket purchase agreement to serve as an assisted acquisition, available to all government entities (civilian, defense, state, local, tribal and territorial). In this manner, the program can offer streamlined acquisition processes and take advantage of stair step pricing.","The program completed both an alternatives analysis and solution engineering analysis. The ROI reflected in the AA section of the Exhibit 300 is reflective of the Solution Engineering Analysis. Within the AA, there was an assumption that since mitigation was not included within the investment, there could be no claim of removal of threat. However, the solution engineering analysis determined that the best approach would be an ROI calculated based on the potential mitigation of known threats and vulnerabilities. The ROI is based solely upon benefits/investment of Increment 1 since Increments 2 and 3 are not currently defined well enough to determine benefits. ROI is calculated as Rate of Return = (Gain of Investment/ Cost of Investment) - 1. Three sources were used to calculate the benefits of mitigation activities. Method 1 - Cost Per Attack; Method 2 - Ponemon Institute/HP Study 2011; Method 3 - Banking Article. These three sources are all comparable, calculating the same benefits. The three sources were averaged because it is unknown which source would represent a more realistic scenario to the federal government. The true benefits could lie anywhere within the range shown in these calculations. As stated above, these three methods were averaged. The average benefit would be approximately $0.9B in BY13$. Then, to calculate the ROI, to the $0.9B, the difference in O&M costs from the baseline were added, and then that result was divided by the Investment + PMO costs for Increment 1 would be the following: ROI 1: (($419.85+-308.03)/391.208)-1= 71.42%ROI 2: ((2012.83+-308.03)/391.208)-1 = 335.78%ROI 3: ((369.29+-308.03)/391.208)-1 = -84.34 The average benefit is ((419.85+2012.83+369.29)+-308.03)/391.208 - 1 = 60.01%.","Prior year 2013: Program  established the CDM Tools/CMaaS BPA in August 2013; developed a solicitation valued at $59.5 million for CDM tools on behalf of 21 departments/agencies; developed acquisition strategy to provide both tools and integration services to 50 D/As qualified to participate in the CDM program (e.g. had signed CDM Memoranda of Agreement) The program also worked on completing required DHS Management Directive 102-01 program documents, including completion and approval of the Integrated Logistics Supply Plan, System Engineering Lifecycle Plan, Test and Evaluation Master Plan and necessary updates to the Lifecycle Cost Estimate.","Current year 2014: The program awarded through GSA four contracts valued at $59.5 million for CDM tools which were delivered in second and third quarter 2014 to the 21 participating agencies. In addition, the program awarded a contract, valued at just under $49 million, for the CDM dashboard solution for both agencies and the federal level. The program is actively engaged in developing solicitation packages that will be released in several iterations in 2014 to deliver tools and integration services to the 50  agencies.The investment objectives for CY, BY, and budget out years are to enable Departments and Agencies (D/As) to improve security posture and achieve targeted cost reductions; centrally oversee the procurement, operations, and maintenance of diagnostic sensors (tools) and dashboards deployed to each agency; to enable D/As to identify which problems to fix first, and empower technical managers to prioritize and mitigate risks; maintain a Federal dashboard to provide situational awareness on a federal level; deploy tools and sensors to D/A networks to identify security risks and vulnerabilities; and provide Continuous Monitoring as a Service (CMaaS) to support data integration and agency customization services. These objectives will be accomplished through leveraging the Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for Continuous Monitoring as a Service (CMaaS) -which provides tools and services to departments and agencies at a reduced cost. In addition, in BY15 and Budget out years the program will develop technical requirements for new CDM capabilities and modify the BPA accordingly. In addition, it will deploy agency and federal-level dashboards; work closely with departments and agencies to understand requirements and enhance buy-in; and gather usability metrics on the tools and services to drive improvement in future iterations of both the tools and the dashboard. This will improve the security posture of federal .gov networks and the effectiveness and efficiency by which federal networks are secured; build maturity into the continuous monitoring/diagnostics program across the federal enterprise; develop a federal network infrastructure that is solidly based on secure engineering principles; transfer risk to where it appropriately belongs and establish and maintain accountability; and fix the worst items first, allowing real-time prioritization of remediation activities.","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","no","","no","0.000000","168.061000","142.633000","102.659000","2012","2025","This investment was included in the FY2013 President's Budget request  but there have not been any approved changes as of today.","EVM is not required for most of the contracts listed above because they are for firm fixed price contracts; in addition, for those awarded to FFRDCs, the activities were undertaken to establish foundational work for CDM. EVM will be required in the CMaaS task orders as well as in the dashboard task order.","3","The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program is in the Obtain life cycle phase.  During the previous review cycle CDM was recognized as a U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative.  The program was able to provide a 30% reduction in GSA pricing to civilian Departments and Agencies, resulting in a cost savings of $26 million.  Erroneous reporting reflects an incorrect cost variance outside OMB's acceptable threshold.  Program leadership is actively pursuing corrective actions to remedy this reporting error, while the program's schedule remains within OMB tolerance.  The program has completed Acquisition Decision Event (ADE) 2B for Phase 1.  An Acquisition Review Board (ARB) for Phase 2 ADE-2B is scheduled for 3Q FY2015.  All key acquisition documents have been completed and approved.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was completed and requirements were finalized for the program's dashboard initiative.  Program leadership has requested additional resources in anticipation of the increased workload and is poised for initial dashboard deployment to Departments and Agencies in FY2016.

OAM protects the American people and the nation's critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of integrated air and marine forces to detect, interdict and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs and other contraband toward or across the borders of the United States. Air-to-Air Enforcement involves the capability to search, detect, track and sort airborne suspect targets which are primarily general aviation aircraft. In a national security role, this serves the function of determining hostile intent of the suspect aircraft. Air interdiction is conducted over both land and sea in all weather conditions and operating environments. TARS is utilized by CBP's Air & Marine branch as its primary tool to identify and track suspect targets. TARS is an aerostat-borne surveillance system that provides radar detection and monitoring of low-flying aircraft and maritime/ground traffic along the U.S.-Mexico border, Florida Straits, and Puerto Rico. Radar information from TARS is distributed to multiple operations centers run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the U.S. Military. TARS provides a unique look-down radar capability that allows CBP to detect aircraft that would not be detected through a ground base system due to its low altitude and/or terrain masking limitations. While operating at 10,000 feet, the TARS radar has been optimized to detect low (0 - 2,000 feet above sea level) and slow (0 - 1,000 knots) aircraft at a range of 200 nautical miles.OAM is the primary customer of the TARS program.  Key stakeholders within CBP include the Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition (which manages the program), the Border Patrol, Office of Administration, Office of Information Technology, and Office of the Commissioner.  Key stakeholders outside of CBP include Western/Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS/WADS), Department of Homeland Security, Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF South), Federal Aviation Administration, USCG, and the Government of Mexico.  The primary beneficiaries - OAM, DoD, FAA, USCG and international partners - all benefit from sharing information to manage airspace.","024-042 : Securing America's Borders","The TARS program was transferred to CBP from the U.S. Air Force on October 1, 2013.  Efforts are currently under way to properly assess and designate TARS as part of the DHS Domain Awareness portfolio (subsection 4.6 in the DHS Enterprise Roadmap) and the Integrated Domain Awareness Segment Architecture (subsection 5.2 of the DHS Enterprise Roadmap).","TARS return on investment is primarily related to increased interdiction and seizure of contraband.  CBP operators rely on TARS today, and likely will for the foreseeable future, to fulfill primary domain awareness missions and responsibilities along the southwest border.  TARS sources 80-90% of suspicious air tracks along the SWB logged at the Air & Marine Operations Center (AMOC), including ultralight and short-lander aircraft threats. The below descriptions highlight specific threat activity along the southwest border for which TARS is particularly useful.Ultralights: These unconventional aircraft have been used to smuggle contraband into the US over the years.  These aircraft are difficult to detect by ground-based radars; TARS is able to detect these aircraft by being at altitude, and with the surface channel set for such slow moving targets.Short-landers: Short-landers are aircraft that originate south of the border, fly on a path toward the US border often without IFF transponders, but then land somewhere short of the border at clandestine airfields. Short-landers are at an all-time high this year, and are typically smugglers that would likely continue into US airspace to land and off-load or air drop their illicit cargo if TARS were not available to facilitate our identification and interdiction of these threats. Because these types of air threats originate south of the border, CBP has initiated several law enforcement coordination efforts, to include real-time sharing of this radar data, with the Government of Mexico to improve our combined effectiveness against these threats.  TARS also has major international data sharing and law enforcement cooperative initiatives with Mexican police and security forces.","DHS announced its intent to assume operations of the TARS program in February of 2013. CBP had less than 8 months to form a program team, develop and execute a transition plan, accept operational responsibility, and establish a program budget towards the tail end of a budget cycle.  Additionally, the transition plan outlined an innovative strategy for CBP to assume ownership of two existing contracts that had two exercise years remaining.  This approach enabled CBP to seamlessly continue operations going forward on October 1, despite a 16 day government shutdown.  The PM worked with DHS to submit a Congressional reprogramming authorizing CBP to accept the program and worked with OMB to establish FY 2014 funding within a CBP appropriation. By the end of FY 2014 all eight TARS sites will be operational for the first time in nearly three years.","The current and future TARS goals are as follows:Goal 1: Restore 8 sites to full mission capability and replenish TARS critical spares (CY).Goal 2: Gain baseline approval of TARS program through 2020 (baseline program is fully mission capable with appropriate spares) (CY & BY).Goal 3: Initiate follow-on contract for baseline program (CY, BY & out years.Goal 4: Initiate TARS sensor payload modernization program (CY, BY & out years).Goal 5: Reset TARS program and contract management model - demonstrate improved outcomes (CY & BY).","yes","no","no","no","no","no","no","yes","","no","0.000000","37.400000","37.400000","37.378000","2014","2023","There are no changes from the 2015 President's Budget for PY and CY.","Not required - the program is not a development program but in steady state O&M.","3","The CBP Tethered Aerostat Radar System program is in the Support phase of its lifecycle.

This includes CBP owned and leased, General Services Administration (GSA) owned and leased, and free space agreements.  Each facility and structure enables CBP employees to more efficiently and effectively carry out the mission of CBP. This diverse real property portfolio includes ports of entry, Border Patrol stations, aircraft hangers, and border security fences. FM&E is responsible for the management and maintenance of CBP's owned facilities as well as the construction and leasing of new facilities. The complexity of operations and continued growth and expansion dictates an integrated facilities lifecycle management solution to manage this portfolio.FM&E required a seamless, integrated enterprise-level solution that synchronizes data between disparate stand-alone systems and provides users a single interface. FM&E required transparency of data across all units and a system that provides significant functionality such as:*          Real property portfolio management*          Facilities maintenance management; including preventive maintenance schedules*          Spatial management*          Utilities management*          Program management dashboard*          Workload analysis*          Planning & acquisition including a cost estimate tool*          Project management*          Developed an ad hoc reporting capability*          Ability to interface with Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) programs and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).As a fully integrated system, TRIRIGA is responsible for the management and maintenance of CBP's vast portfolio of facilities.  By eliminating several outdated and disconnected systems, TRIRIGA provides one location for everything for FM&E to successfully manage facilities-related projects, maintenance, and repairs.  As of this submission, TRIRIGA contains assessment data for 1,059 owned facilities.  The stakeholders of TRIRIGA include a user community of over 400 users; the Facilities Management & Engineering office, including the Executive Director; those that rely on accurate reporting for facilities and maintenance.","024-042 : Securing America's Borders","TRIRIGA is an integrated workplace management system that replaced many outdated, and disconnected systems.  TRIRIGA has improved efficiencies to Facilities Management & Engineering (FM&E).  Not only does TRIRIGA provide the source data for CBP reporting to the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) and DHS's Real Property Data Warehouse (DHS-RPDW), it also provides the critical facilities data for CBP's geospatial information systems and improved processes for managing operation and maintenance.   This investment supports DHS Mission 2 - Secure and Manage Our Borders by providing facilities and structures that enable CBP employees to more efficiently and effectively carry out its mission.It contributes to the DHS target EA by contributing to the enterprise business services portfolio (asset management).","TRIRIGA has been in O&M since 2012.  Because it will only recover its costs through operations, it will not generate any return on investment.  Before the implementation of TRIRIGA, CBP FM&E did not possess a tool to accurately record all of CBP's facilities, to include the capabilities of conducting assessments.  There were multiple, disparate systems collecting data on facilities, assessments, and projects.  TRIRIGA addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  Continuous improvements to the federal reporting capabilities of TRIRIGA enable FM&E to more effectively and efficiently provide facilities portfolio information to DHS.    The implementation of TRIRIGA has provided many benefits to Facilities Management & Engineering (FM&E).  Now in its third year, not only does TRIRIGA provide the source data for CBP reporting to the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) and DHS's Real Property Data Warehouse (DHS-RPDW), it also provides the critical facilities data for CBP's geospatial information systems and improved processes for managing operation and maintenance.  Before TRIRIGA, there was not a single source for facilities condition assessments (FCAs) or the facilities condition index (FCI), which provides an overall snapshot of the health of CBP facilities.  As the agency moves towards maintenance of the existing portfolio, and less new construction, the FCI will be critical in determining required funding, as well as prioritizing need. Although there are limited data points, TRIRIGA is generally well-received by the user community, as is demonstrated by the results of two annual user satisfaction surveys.  Our target satisfaction is 4.00 (out of 5), or 80%.  While we have yet to meet that target, we have increased from 63% (3.15) to 65% (3.25).  While the increase is not significant it is fairly representative of the growth of a newly implemented system.  We anticipate an even higher score in the next survey.","Accomplishments for the investment year FY2014 include: Pre-PMO Review (Portfolio Approval Routing) Redesign, Platform Upgrade (3.2.2.1), Performance Metrics, and Cultural Resource Information Organization System (CRIOS).  The application upgrade brought TRIRIGA up-to-date with IBM's support matrix, continuing technical support and preparing it for the application upgrade.  The Pre-PMO Review redesign removed unnecessary redundancy and steps in the approval of new or updated portfolio records in the system.  Performance Metrics was implemented to provide CBP FM&E leadership a snapshot of the health of capital projects. Leadership can now, in one portal, identify those projects that are underperforming.  The CRIOS project retired a legacy system that identified and tracked cultural resources.  Now in TRIRIGA, project managers and key personnel can quickly identify where these artifacts and resources reside, reducing the likelihood of mistakenly of damaging cultural resources.","Planned major accomplishments for FY 2015 include those approved by the nascent TRIRIGA Steering Committee (TSC).FY 2015:Major Application upgrade to TRIRIGA (version 10.3.2) - brings TRIRIGA up to the most recently supported application version, and provides additional benefits, mainly in the area of GIS;Conversion of instructor led training (ILT) to Web-based, on-demand models - provides on-demand training to end users, and reduces the costs of providing training by vastly reducing travel costs associated with ILTs;GSA Rent Reconciliation; reduces the time needed to reconcile rent costs with GSA;Adding Project Cost Code without Applying Cost Code Template - necessary for users in unique situations, typically when it is necessary to remap funding from Expense to Capital or Capital to Expense;Develop SAP to TRIRIGA Integration for Leases - improves visibility of leasing information shared between SAP and TRIRIGA;Automate Percent of Complete Form - reduces the number of POC forms from four (4) to one (1), and eliminates the use of separate spreadsheets.

Therefore, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Chief Information Officer (CIO) assesses the TRIRIGA program as a Medium Risk investment.","Yellow","09/09/2014","09/09/2014","3","01/13/2015","06/20/2015","06/20/2015","Update Required","10/29/2014","09/09/2014","08/27/2015","","2016","2014-09-09 11:43:52","2014-09-09 11:43:52","02/05/2015"
"024-000007006","1483","024","Department of Homeland Security","70","Federal Emergency Management Agency","FEMA - Non-Disaster (ND) Grants","The Non-Disaster (ND) Grants project's purpose is: establish, implement, operate and maintain (O&M) the system, solution and sustaining infrastructure for an Enterprise-level, unified, coordinated, and automated grants management system supporting the full grants management lifecycle of multiple DHS grants programs. A single project office is chartered to provide governance, technical expertise, training, system development, and O&M effectively executing grants functions in a single automated system (ND Grants). ND Grants is a mixed lifecycle system past ADE-2 performing system enhancements, integration, legacy systems migration into ND Grants, and O&M.  Benefits include: a single automated grants management system consolidating multiple fragmented, non-integrated and incompatible grants management processes, lifecycles, systems and some 119 DHS-wide grant programs; real-time transactional input, updates and feedback; standardized, structured and searchable data format facilitating data collection, collation, and analytics; sequenced, reliable and complete workflows; automated pending/real-time action notifications; integration with financial, and asset management systems of record and other essential systems (IFMIS, Grants.gov, PARS); and integrated standardized and ad-hoc reporting linking outcome to grant award performance. Project goals and objective align with larger mission delivery goals and objectives of the DHS Strategic Plan, Mission Area 5: Ensuring Resilience to Disasters: meeting objectives defined by Goal 5.1: Mitigate Hazards, Goal 5.2: Enhance National Preparedness; Goal 5.3 Ensure Effective Emergency Response; and Goal 5.4 Rapid Recovery.  The Project supports mission delivery goals/objectives providing a single information source for oversight, advanced planning, coordination, management and execution of efforts to enhance, sustain, and continue capacity of state/local emergency responders to anticipate and develop proactive strategies and capabilities to prevent, respond to, and recover from potential threats through the strategic selection and tactical deployment and distribution/allocation of preparedness grant funding (approx. $4 Billion).  Beneficiaries are: U.S. citizens/communities; private/nonprofit sectors, faith/community-based organizations; federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial first responders and partners. Customers are: Federal PMs, grants assist personnel, State Admin. Agents, and grant applicants; and grantees.","024-006 : Preparedness","The ND Grants system has been incorporated into the DHS EA Roadmap as a component of the DHS EA Segment Architecture collaborative business community of: 5.9 Financial Assistance Segment Architecture (FASA): as part of its collaborative, business-driven process to assist DHS in understanding the most effective way to manage the Department's financial assistance (FA) lifecycle--better serving the stakeholders that receive grants, loans, and other forms of financial assistance from DHS.  Strategic Improvement Opportunities (SIOs) identified within the EA include the following SIOs: Expand IT Functionality to Increase Efficiency; Improve Data Management and Information Sharing; Improve Communication and Collaboration, Develop Enterprise-wide Processes, Develop Workforce Training, Establish Governance of FA IT Portfolio and Improvement Projects; and Establish Performance Management.  The ND Grants program is specifically sighted in the DHS EA Roadmap (page 97) One current effort by FEMA to reduce this overlap (number of overlapping systems), as well as gaps in service (i.e. they are fragmented and done manually) and lack of system-coverage is building out its non-Disaster Grants system, and consolidating it with several other systems to create a unified Enterprise Grants Platform. ND Grants was not included in the DHS Joint Portfolio Review for Fiscal Year 2013, 2014, or Budget Year 2015.  ND Grants was not part of the developed prioritized list of IT investments by portfolio, nor were any Department-level recommendations developed for continuation, cancellation, or disposition of the ND Grants Project.  Therefore, the ND Grants Project was not specifically included in the development of and review of the DHS Resource Allocation Plan (RAP) and subsequent Resource Allocation Decision (RAD) for Budget Year 2015.   While no new technology is being introduced through design, development and implementation of the ND Grants Program---the introduction of the ND Grants System will improve programmatic performance, processes, and improve effectiveness, efficiencies, and internal controls as well as meeting regulatory compliance for GMS Department-wide.  Also as other existing systems are migrated to the ND Grants environment cost reductions will be achieved as these migrated systems are closed and dispositioned.","An initial alternatives analysis was completed in Fiscal Year 2005 where seven existing DHS grants managements systems were evaluated against a set of requirements developed via creation of a grants management value chain.  Subsequent to this initial feasibility study an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was completed in August 2006 (and up-dated in December 2007) that determined a scenario entitled: Modified AFG provided the greatest return-on-investment (ROI), Net Present Value (NPV) over the shortest Payback Period (PP) of the alternatives analyzed.  The alternative of choice was forecasted to generated a (24%) ROI. NPV: $4.73 Million; and PP of 3 years.  A second A0A was completed that determined a scenario entitled: Grants Management Integrated Environment (GMIE) provided the greatest return-on-investment (ROI), Net Present Value (NPV) and shortest Payback Period (PP) of the alternatives analyzed.  It generated a (26.12%) ROI. PV Costs Benefit: $7.94 Million; and PP of 6 years compared to the closest alternative the PRISM Scenario that returned a (17.30 %) ROI; PV Costs Benefit: $6.14 Million; and PP of 7 years.   Anticipate internal benefits include: decreased durations to achieve system functionality in the production environment (achieved through the development, modernization, and enhancement of an existing DHS/FEMA GMS Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG)); eliminating duplicative design/development and O&M efforts across multiple GMSs (achieved by consolidating GMSs into ND Grants and creating a configuration management process incorporating all stakeholder requirements); streamlined oversight and management (achieved via Charter of the ND Grants Project); improved and complete workflow and processes (achieved in creating a unified, single grants management lifecycle through effective business process management); elimination of significant capital costs necessary for building a system from scratch (achieved through  the development, modernization, and enhancement of an existing DHS/FEMA GMS AFG); decreased incremental costs and consolidated operations and maintenance cost (achieved through migration of systems into the modified AFG environment and closure/disposition of those unneeded systems). External benefits include: users, grant applicants and grantees interface with a single system GMS for all grant applications processes, workflows, and lifecycles experience a common and familiar view for all grant application.","Against the Integrated Master Schedule (baseline) will achieve: WBS 1.1.11.5.1 Goal/Product/Objective: Complete ND Grants Budget Year 2016 Exhibit 300 (Date: September 2014)WBS 1.1.14.5 Goal/Product/Objective: Complete C&A Package, Remediate NFR and achieve ATO (Date: July 2014)WBS 1.2.1.2.1.1 Goal/Product/Objective: Consolidate Rules/Grants Business Processes and Functional Business Rules Engine (Date: September 2014)WBS 1.2.1.2.1.2 Goal/Product/Objective: Enable ND Grants Standard and Ad-hoc Forms Capability; Establish ND Grants Data Repository and Repository Service (Date: September 2014)WBS 1.2.1.2.3.1 Goal/Product/Objective: Create Ability to Obligate and Commit Vendor Funding as an Integrated Function within ND Grants with IFMIS (Date: June 2014)WBS 1.2.1.3.1.3 Goal/Product/Objective: Establish GRT Data Records/Field Structure and Schema in ND Grants; Transition Former GRT data and metadata migrated to ND Grants; closure of GRT (Date: September 2014).","CY15: Consistent with the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), achieve the following overall performance goals, objectives, and milestones:*         WBS 1.1.11 Goal/Product/Objective: Execute the FY15 Budget, Finalize BY16, and formulate BY17 ND Grants Exhibit 300 (Date: September 2015)*         WBS 1.1.14.6 Goal/Product/Objective: Remediate NFR (Date: July 2015)*         WBS 1.2.1.2.1.2 Goal/Product/Objective: Improve ND Grants application functionality -- perform Repository Services Refactoring: streamline database calls eliminating bottlenecks, improve overall performance to database access (Date: September 2015)*         WBS 1.2.1.3.1.3 Goal/Product/Objective: Migrate GRT Data Records/Field Structure and Schema in ND Grants; Former GRT data and metadata migrated to ND Grants; closure of GRT (Date: September 2015)BY16: Consistent with the IMS, achieve the following overall performance goals, objectives, and milestones:*         WBS 1.1.11.6 Goal/Product/Objective: Execute the FY15 Budget, Finalize BY16 and complete BY17 ND Grants Exhibit 300 (Date: September 2016)*         WBS 1.1.14.7 Goal/Product/Objective: Completed C&A Package, Remediate NFR and achieve ATO (Date: September 2016)*         WBS 1.2.1.3.3 Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Phase 1: Goal/Product/Objective: Build AFG closeout functionality in the user stories, grant awarding to fire departments processing functionality into ND Grants (Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S), Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) and Fire Station Construction Grants (SCG) grants programs) (Date: September 2016)*         WBS 1.2.1.3.4 Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Phase 2: Goal/Product/Objective: Make legacy AFG functionality available in NG Grants related to payments and reporting identified in user stories (Date: September 2016)-          WBS 1.2.1.3.6 Project Based Grants: Goal/Product/Objective: Provide configurability in ND Grants for collection of portfolio-level data and information improving grants allocations, distributions, and expenditures from a portfolio management approach.
