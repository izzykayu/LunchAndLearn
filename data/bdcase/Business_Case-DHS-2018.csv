Strategic Impact and Effectiveness: DAIP continues to support DHS strategic goals tied to both the QHSR and the DHS multi-year Strategic Plan. DAIP reduced costs and improved efficiencies by streamlining and consolidating the delivery of disaster assistance to disaster survivors. Disasterassistance.gov reduces the time needed to apply for aid and check the status of claims while decreasing redundancy in application forms and processes.
Customer Results and Satisfaction: Disaster survivors continue to adopt the online portal as a means for accessing and applying for forms of assistance. Current quarterly reports show that the Disasterassistance.gov website is an intuitive and user-friendly portal. The reports will continue to be evaluated in order to validate the interpretation of the results. 
Financial Performance: DAIP continues to perform well within the stated variance levels mandated by DHS and there are no outstanding cost, schedule, or performance risk issues.
System Technology and Enterprise Architecture: The system was deemed technically compliant and met the system availability goals; it appropriately mapped to the DHS and Federal Enterprise Architecture, linked to the agency performance goals, and is compliant with all security and privacy requirements. DAIP needs a new cloud infrastructure to close performance gaps against the EO, for the technical and program benefits and to also adhere to OMB’s Federal CIO Cloud First Mandate.
Innovation: As required by OMB’s Cloud First Mandate and DHS guidance, the program’s cloud-based infrastructure will bring about a reduction in operational costs while allowing for surge as needed and providing the necessary elasticity to support the DHS mandated volume of registrations. This infrastructure is necessary to increase access to disaster assistance while improving interoperability and system performance.
Risk Analysis: The program manages and tracks risks on a continuous basis. The program’s risk management process includes examining the program for potential risks in the 19 areas identified by OMB. In addition, the team continuously develops and updates mitigation plans for active risks.",4,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) is in the Mixed life cycle phase. The program is operating within OMB specified range for Cost Variance (CV) and Schedule Variance (SV). The primary DAIP public portal, DisasterAssistance.Gov, made two system releases during CY16. Another 10 monthly releases for content and user interface were completed during Q4 FY16. DAIP has one active project: “Disaster Assistance Re-Engineering Effort (DARE). Project cost and schedule are following the Acquisition Program Baseline. This is planned for completion during Q4 FY18. The current Operational Analysis reports six major areas in which DAIP is successfully performing. Strategic impact and effectiveness are realized through a web portal that consolidates disaster assistance information in one place. Positive customer results are shown for disaster survivors in obtaining forms of assistance (FOA). Program innovation with technology also enhances the customer experience. Planned DAIP objectives include a mix of policy and technology enhancements. Implementing mobile and SMS text message capabilities will allow disaster survivors access to assistance information in the most likely means available immediately following a disaster when phone and power lines are damaged. The use of GIS mapping (such as Google maps) technology can provide local resource searches on DisasterAssistance.gov. DAIP has new and modified Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) to represent progress towards closing requirement gaps. These are: 1) Utilizing a Cloud solution to meet surge demand, 2) Increasing application status access, 3) Cost reductions and 4) Expanding Federal Forms of Assistance (FOA) Participation.

2. FY17 funding increase will support the extension of Strong Authentication, PIV, and TIE capabilities
 
Recommendations
1. Continue to monitor Component progress to implement Mandatory PIV and escalate to senior management where appropriate leveraging the governance structure.
2. Continue implementation of enterprise services to support DHS mission and goals to support ICAM requirement and close operational gaps.
3. Identify opportunities to reused existing systems and applications to meet DHS ICAM requirements.

Summary 
Customer Results- The User Assessment/Evaluation found major progress toward meeting customer needs. Mandatory PIV compliance increased significantly and the Trusted Identity Exchange (TIE) met its service targets. 

Strategic and Business Results- The ICAM Program continues to be closely aligned with DHS Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) objectives, federal mandates, and customers’ business needs. ICAM services serve the business needs of the Department by strengthening security, improving interoperability between DHS Components, and enhancing customer service.

Financial Performance- Cost Benefit Analyses (CBA) recommended the Enterprise Implementation as the best alternative. In addition to the cost avoidance benefits, the enterprise-wide approach offers efficiency gains and ensures accountability in meeting targets.

Innovation- The ICAM Program provides for additional innovation for ICAM capabilities beyond Mandatory PIV authentication. Access Lifecycle Management (ALM) will automate and digitally-manage access management. Derived PIV Credentials is a leading edge technology that will provide strong authentication on mobile devices.

Operational Performance Measures- Targets have been established for the ICAM Program based on federal mandates and DHS leadership guidance. The ICAM Program collects performance data on Mandatory PIV authentication compliance for unprivileged, privileged, and remote users. 

Risk Analysis- The most significant dependency for the ICAM Program is Component achievement of 100% Mandatory PIV compliance. The ICAM Program actively works to mitigate risks associated with this dependency through metrics reporting and consulting efforts with Component ICAM counterparts.",4,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM) program is in the Mixed life cycle phase.

Although CLAIMS 3 is a legacy system initiated in the early 1990’s, it continues to exceed volume processing expectations as well as investment lifecycle estimations.  CLAIMS 3 is now accessible to 100% of the USCIS locations and the system availability and reliability are well within defined expectations.

Customer Results is good in terms of access, availability, reliability, and data sharing. However, it noted that there are some issues with flexibility in terms of meeting emerging needs.  For Strategic & Business Results, CLAIMS 3 does not fit with USCIS goals of moving to a paperless, customer-centric process.  However, CLAIMS 3 remains an effective program for meeting current USCIS demands as USCIS transitions to the transformed environment.  As for Internal Business Process, CLAIMS 3 provides the ability to receipt, adjudicate, and produce customer proofs of benefit for over 90% of Immigration forms.

The TSA’s mission is to protect the Nation’s transportation systems. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) mission is to detect, deter, and defeat hostile acts targeting U.S. air carriers, airports, passengers, and crews. The purpose of the Mission Scheduling and Notification System (MSNS) is to provide mission-critical, operational information support for the FAMS. The goal of MSNS is to help ensure that the FAMS is able to execute its transportation safety mission easily and efficiently, while providing system flexibility and evolving capabilities to meet changing mission needs in the coming years. 
Some of the current benefits of MSNS include its specific contributions to the FAMS mission: 
1) It automatically determines allocation of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) to flights using Industry-leading planning and manpower allocation software which incorporates TSA's risk-based strategies, FAMS policies, and individual FAM limitations;
2) It automatically coordinates and communicates mission assignments with Operations, Field Offices, and FAM personnel;
3) It automatically reserves, changes, and cancels airline tickets; 
4) Its automatic reservation and ticketing causes less disruption to the airline industry over manual methods;
5) It automatically tracks mission execution and supports operational changes to previous plans;
6) It provides live fail-over, disaster recovery, and Continuity of Operations (COOP) capabilities to ensure FAMS mission-critical information is available annually 99.999% of the time, 24x7x365;
7) It facilitates a smaller and stronger security perimeter around operational information by reducing the number of people needed to accomplish tasks in the FAMS mission.

Based on a further 5 years of utility, using the MSNS system results in a net benefit of approximately 5*$30.7M = $153.5M which was calculated based on input from FAMS Flight Operations division.
In addition, the following qualitative benefits continue to be achieved through improved automation:
Each month, MSNS facilitates coordination of thousands of air marshal availability schedules. This greatly reduces the amount of time it takes to create FAM missions.
Each month, MSNS automatically communicates tens of thousands of mission assignments with FAMS field offices and air marshals. This dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to notify the workforce of their assigned FAM missions.
MSNS is now able to more efficiently and more cost effectively reserve and purchase tens of thousands of airline tickets for air marshals every month. This drastically reduces the amount of time it would take to perform this task manually.
On a 24x7 basis, MSNS is now able to more accurately track FAMS mission execution and facilitate live mission updates in response to a wide variety of emergent conditions in the global air transport system.  This improved tracking capability increases situational awareness of personnel at the FAMS Transportation Security Operations Center (TSOC). It also keeps them informed of the status of FAMS currently flying on missions at all times on a real-time basis, and in turn greatly increases the speed and frequency at which they receive flight status updates.","ATSA: SEC. 105.

TSA customers include Office of Security Operations (OSO), Office of Security Capabilities (OSC), and Office of Intelligence Analysis (OIA). Other beneficiaries are the airline travelers and local law enforcement.",024-023,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","The ROI of 87.8% indicates that STIP is a performing program that, when fully implemented, external benefits will increase such that the initial acquisition costs will be recovered and the program will return $0.88 for every acquisition dollar invested. The initial STIP CBA was conducted in 2006. The current ROI is derived from the 2015 STIP CBA update, which updated the most current costs and expected benefits for the selected alternative. By integration/networking of screening equipment (TSE), STIP provides cost savings for TSA through efficiencies gained by 1) automating data collection process which results in time savings for TSOs no longer having to manually collect data from all the STIP-enabled TSEs at the check point and checked baggage area.  2) Remote Monitoring and Maintenance (RMM) capability has the potential to reduce time required for maintenance technicians to travel to the TSE that requires diagnostics and consequently reduce maintenance costs for EBSP and PSP.     

Benefits of a continued investment in STIP baseline capabilities and software development to have the STIP Application Suite (STIP AS) interface with the Office of Security Operations (OSO) Performance Information Management System/Performance Management Information System (PIMS/PMIS) include a reduction of the data collection burden that each airport has to undertake to collect various data points and manually enter into the PIMS/PMIS database.  An additional investment for EMD (Enhanced Metal Detector) retrofits to enable automated collection of passenger throughput and alarm data counts will result in the enhancement of STIP baseline capabilities, due to higher accuracy and fidelity of passenger counts, developed and further reduce the OSO data collection burden.  Investment in future software development efforts and business process development for a Remote Monitoring and Maintenance (RMM) capability  provides benefits in terms of maintenance savings for TSEs, regardless of their warranty status or maintenance provider.  Additionally, RMM provides efficiencies gained by streamlining the maintenance issue diagnosis and resolution and the potential for an increase in uptime of TSE. 

A positive ROI indicates that the purchase and implementation of new capital assets to create a new capability should result in a net reduction in recurring costs over the investment lifecycle greater than the total of the original non-recurring costs required to create said capability.","STIP is an Information Technology (IT) program with the goal of addressing the need for an automated exchange of information between TSE and TSA stakeholders. By addressing this need, STIP addresses the following key capability gaps identified by the TSA: 
 
1.      Security: TSA lacks the capability to dynamically transfer information between TSE and vetting and security operations. 
2.      Configuration Management: TSA lacks the capability to automatically upload configuration updates and software on TSE, as well as capability to efficiently collect, track, and harmonize configuration settings on TSE.
3.       Information Sharing and Enterprise Management: TSA lacks the capability to automate data collection processes used to capture and upload operational data for TSE.
4.      Resource Management: TSA lacks the capability to automatically collect Transportation Security Officer (TSO) threat detection performance data from TSE. 
5.      Remote Monitoring and Maintenance: TSA lacks the capability to remotely monitor and maintain the health of TSE.

As this is a fee-based program, the fee charged may cover services performed: threat assessment fees may be equal to threat assessment expenses since the government may not make a profit on services rendered. 
Hazmat Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) return on investment cannot be measured in terms of dollars because of the intangible benefits that related to preventing acts of terrorism from occurring. The value that HTAP provides cannot be measured in monetary terms since it is providing matching and vetting services and strengthens national security by identifying high and low risk persons in order to mitigate known and unknown threats involved in the transport of hazardous materials.  This program provides quantifiable societal benefits by reducing the risk of terrorist events and the resulting economic impact if a government-controlled watch list and threat assessment process is not implemented. Benefits attributable to the capability are assumed to be a small portion of the cost of damages that would result from not preventing a terrorist from transporting hazardous materials. 
Additionally, this investment provides the following qualitative benefits to user groups for which the capability has been implemented:
1. Enables strict security controls
2. In non-agent states, leverages DMV infrastructure for transmittal/receipt of results prior to HME endorsement issuance
3. Integrates automated watch list matching and manual review and resolution of near matches.
4.

These statutes require DHS to prevent individuals from entering a secure area of a vessel or facility unless the individual holds a transportation security card or is accompanied by another individual who holds a card.
Contribution to Mission Delivery or Agency Management Support Functions: In accordance with the DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog, Version 2.0, dated June 2014, the TWIC program supports the PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY Mission and the Screening function as listed in the Capability Portfolio.  As of August 1, 2016, more than 4.0 million workers had applied for a TWIC.
Goals: The TWIC program provides a vital security measure to ensure that individuals who pose a security threat do not gain unescorted access to secure areas of the nation’s maritime transportation industry. 
Current or Anticipated Benefits: TSA (1) positively verifies each applicant’s claimed identity; (2) performs a security threat assessment on each applicant; and (3) produces and issues a TWIC card containing biometric and physical information for each applicant meeting the threat assessment eligibility requirements. The TWIC security threat assessment provides a terrorism/intelligence check, a criminal history records check, and an immigration check. TWICs are tamper-resistant biometric credentials. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Key Customers, Stakeholders, and other Beneficiaries: Workers who may be required to obtain a TWIC include facility employees, longshoremen, U.S. mariners, deckhands, long haul and drayage truck drivers, laborers, and other individuals requiring unescorted access to secureareas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels. The TWIC program maintains an extensive outreach effort to an exceptionally diverse group of key stakeholders: Congress; American Association of Port Authorities; National Association of Waterfront Employers; American Trucking Association; American Waterways Operators; Offshore Marine Service Association; Passenger Vessel Association; Intermodal Association of North America; International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union and others.",024-024,"3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks, 3264 - Goal 1.3:  Reduce Risk to the Nation's Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events","To calculate ROI, the program did a cash flow analysis using the TWIC Funding History report published by the TSA CFO which has the history of funding for the program up to September 30, 2015.  ROI for the TWIC program is calculated as (Cash In – Cash Out)/Cash Out.  Cash In is derived from two sources, appropriated funding provided early in the program and fee revenue collected from transportation workers once the program reached operational capability.  Consequently, as of September 30, 2015, Cash In (Appropriations) $155.875M + Cash In (Fees) $593.775M = $749.650M; Cash Out (Expenses) = $429.637M; therefore ROI = ($749.650M-$429.637M)/$429.637M = 74.49%.

The program has been in Operations and Maintenance since October 2008. The program's external benefits include providing a biometric credential to over 3.7 million transportation workers as of March 1, 2016. TWIC is one part of the layered approach to port security and establishes a minimum, uniform, vetting and threat assessment requirements for mariners and port workers across the country.  The nationwide recognition of TWIC as the one common credential needed to allow a worker unescorted access to secure areas of facilities and vessels enables facility and vessel operators to verify the identity of individuals, including the use of biometrics—steps that were not feasible prior to TWIC implementation with potentially thousands of different facility-specific credentials.  The credential is being used in over 2500 MTSA-regulated maritime facilities and vessels nationwide.  Through the use of a universally accepted common access card, the TWIC system has eliminated the duplicative costs associated with redundant credentials and application processes, thereby reducing costs to the individual transportation worker. In addition, a simplified program supports efficient execution and a reduced threatwindow.","Legislative Mandate:  The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2002 requires DHS to issue a biometric transportation security card to those requiring unescorted access to MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels after determining the individual does not pose a security risk.

TWIC positively identifies applicants by determining the authenticity of identity documentation, and it conducts a Security Threat Assessment (STA) on each individual, including continuous vetting against Terrorist Screening Databases.
 
Agency Strategic Plan:  TWIC supports DHS Strategic Goal 1.1 – Prevent Terrorist Attacks and Goal 1.3 Reduce Risk to the Nation’s Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events.  Via enrollment and vetting processes, TWIC prevents ineligible applicants from obtaining a TWIC card to gain unescorted access to facilities and vessels.  Also, TWIC supports TSA Strategic Goal 1.0 - Establish a risk-based approach to all operations to identify, manage, and mitigate risk in all TSA lines of business, and Goal 2.0 - External Engagement - Sustain transparent and proactive relationships with external stakeholders and the traveling public.  The TWIC program’s enrollment, vetting, and adjudication processes maintain effective controls to mitigate the risk of an ineligible applicant obtaining a TWIC card.  Also, the TWIC program uses customer service strategies, a stakeholder communications committee, visits to individual facilities and Coast Guard districts/sectors, and speaking at national stakeholder conferences and meetings to maintain communication with transit workers and maritime industry representatives.
 
Outstanding Audit Finding:  As of August 2016, the TWIC program is addressing a GAO recommendation to perform an internal control assessment by analyzing existing controls, identifying related weaknesses and risks, and determining cost effective actions needed to achieve program objectives.  In FY 2017, TSA will conduct an internal control assessment of the TWIC program to further identify internal control strengths, risks, and vulnerabilities.  The assessment will focus on TWIC’s enrollment, vetting, adjudication, and credential issuance processes.",yes,yes,https://www.tsa.gov/for-industry/twic|https://universalenroll.dhs.gov/programs/twic,"Stephanie W.

The Universal Enrollment Services (UES) contract maintains a Call Center to provide transit workers with case status updates and issue resolution.  TWIC staff routinely travel to enrollment centers to evaluate performance, interact with customers, and develop corrective actions.  Strategic and Business Results: The TWIC program makes U.S. ports more secure by providing a federally mandated biometric credential to workers who require access to facility secure areas.  Aligned to DHS and TSA strategic goals, the TWIC program has enrolled and vetted over 4.0M transit workers.  TSA positively identifies applicants by determining the authenticity of identity documentation, and it conducts a Security Threat Assessment (STA) on each individual, including continuous vetting against Terrorist Screening Databases.   Financial Performance: The TWIC program is entirely funded through the fees paid by applicants.  The TWIC Cost Benefit Analysis determined that the program created a new capability to meet DHS and TSA goals.  With a focus on cost efficiencies, TWIC takes advantage of consolidated service delivery contracts to control TWIC costs.  Innovation: The Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) system provides all TWIC infrastructure services and is consolidating all systems that perform adjudication, vetting and credentialing to improve processing.  The Next Generation (NEXGEN) TWIC is a technology refresh project that will allow a migration to PIV-I and utilization of additional security features.  TWIC PMO is also evaluating technologies to provide automated recurrent criminal and immigration vetting capability.

The purpose and goal of TVS is to provide TSA the ability to conduct initial and recurrent name-based matching against defined terrorist related data sets of individuals regulated by TSA who require access to the transportation infrastructure and to determine if they pose a threat to transportation across the various modes and the homeland. The benefit of the investment is an added layer of security and contributes directly to TSA’s mission of protecting the homeland and detecting potential threats to transportation infrastructure. In addition to contributing to the goals/objectives of the DHS QHSR Strategic Plan (DHS Strategic Goal 1.1: Preventing Terrorist Attacks and DHS Strategic Goal 1.3 Manage Risk to Critical Infrastructure). TVS was originally intended to conduct biographic matching of flight crew members that fly into, out of and over US airspace. Over time, the technology supporting the vetting or name-based background checks were leveraged to support the vetting of other transportation related populations regulated by TSA. To date, TVS’s infrastructure conducts vetting for all individuals regulated under TSA’s maritime, surface and aviation security programs. It also, provides a watchlist service for the Secure Flight program and supports the Office of Intelligence’s Encounter Management Division. Specifically, TVS’s infrastructure helps to identify potential threats posed by individuals to transportation infrastructure by conducting initial and recurrent vets of more than 19 million individuals across the transportation infrastructure in a highly efficient, effective and scalable environment. Key customers, stakeholders and beneficiaries of TVS include international flight crews, port workers, hazardous material drivers, airport workers, air carriers, indirect air carriers for access to cargo, other federal government entities and agencies, transportation related associations and advocacy groups.

The recurrent vetting, immediately alerts users on suspects and enables TSA/DHS to protect the people, commerce and infrastructure from an act of terrorism. TVS conducts real-time vetting of Flight Crew for flight to/from and over United States preventing known suspected terrorist (KST) from flying. TVS vetting results aided in providing over 2 million Credentials for Transportation Workers to obtain employment in the Maritime industry, and clearances to over 4 million applicants to enable them to obtain HAZMAT/Commercial Driver’s License. It also provides Watchlist update service to Secure Flight, enabling efficient Secure Flight operations. The vetting benefits are derived from the following alerts to protect against terror threats: (1) subject-to-watchlist match alerts signifying a subject may be on a watchlist; (2) subject-to-subject link alerts signifying a subject who is not on a watchlist may be somehow related to subject who is on a watchlist; (3) subject-to-other match alerts signifying the subject data may contain purposefully deceptive information; and, (4) subject-to-subject match alerts signifying that two or more subject records may represent the same individual; (5) subject-to-encounter match alert signifying that a person may have been also encountered by a partner organization; (6) subject-to-encounter link alert signifying that a person may be somehow linked to a person encountered by a partner organization.

The TIM Program mission is aligned and consistent with the overarching DHS and TSA mission, DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security. The TIM System supports operations by reducing the probability of a successful terrorist attack on the transportation system by applying threat assessment methodologies intended to identify known or suspected terrorist threats working in or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system.

TIM is being built and operated in the DHS datacenter cloud environment. TIM is a fully integrated system utilizing service oriented architecture capable of providing more effective and efficient security threat assessments to all transportation sectors including: surface, maritime and aviation. TIM is the Security Threat Assessment infrastructure focal point for stakeholders including: Congress, FBI, State Department, Coast Guard, State & Local agencies, U.S. airports, U.S. ports, as well as transportation employers, transportation employees, and travelers.

The TIM program’s goals are to improve customer service, provide one-stop shopping, enable a person-centric view, to implement “enroll, once and use many?, to increase the efficiency of security threat assessments and information sharing with federal, state, local authorities and industry partners, to promote secure operations, to support fee-fairness and comparability between credentials for  transportation workers,and to realize economies of scale; as well as operational efficiencies through integration of processes.

TIM customers (transportation workers and travelers) will benefit from the efficiencies and cost avoidance once TIM is fully implemented. Workers and travelers will also experience improved service at a lower cost. TIM is poised to be an Enterprise-level solution for Screening Coordination Office (SCO) Credentialing Framework Initiatives (CFI). TIM is one of the first DHS programs to use DHS Data Center Cloud Services. TIM is paving the way for new security and data sharing methodologies. TIM is a DHS agile pilot program that enables agile responses to changing business conditions and operational requirements via engineered business processes, and seamless information sharing services based on managed data (accurate, timely, trustable) with tuned IT performance.",024-025,"3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","TIM is a Performing Program.  Though not fully implemented yet, the TIM Program already eliminates redundant business practices and processes, TIM also achieves cost and performance efficiencies by integrating now separate IT systems (TWIC, Consolidated Screening Gateway, Screening Gateway, Crew Vetting, Alien Flight Student Program) functionality under one program.  TIM enables support for external stakeholders such as Maritime, Surface, and Aviation transportation worker / traveler populations.

TIM provides TSA internal benefits by enabling information sharing across TSA / DHS.  The TIM system is being designed to function in a cloud environment.  TIM's cloud infrastructure will result in significant cost savings, especially in future years in the O&M phase.  Benefits to external stakeholders include streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person-centric.  TIM is person centric in that the system recognizes workers applying for multiple credentials, endorsements, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation modes.  This person-centric capability enables TSA to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities which saves users time and money.

TIM's STA process uses biometric and biographic information to perform automated immigration, criminal history, finger print, and terrorist watch list checks.  The transportation worker must have an approved STA to start or continue work, or even to apply for a job within the US transportation infrastructure.  Any significant delays impact the worker and may also impact commerce. 

TIM cost benefit analysis computes forecasted savings by subtracting TIM's Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) from the“As Is? Baseline defined in the TIM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The annual savings are projected from 2014 to 2025 is $397M.  The DME investment to achieve these savings is $260M.

The ROI for this investment is computed as ((Benefits – Investment) / Investment).  Thus, the ROI for the TIM DME investment is 53%.

The primary goal of the investment is to support the systems that enable TSA to regulate the activities of Air Carriers and Indirect Air Carriers (IACs), regulate and approve companies to conduct screening operations, and determine the identity, validity, and risk of companies shipping goods on passenger aircraft.  The investment supports QHSR Mission 1: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security and Mission 2: Secure and Manage Our Borders. The investment consists of three major systems, IACMS, KSMS, and FAS, and two minor systems, STAT and DAT, that serve to capture and manage data that help TSA mitigate the risk of terrorist incidents with impact on security operations (domestic and international). IACMS manages the IAC certification and renewal process, ensuring IACs implement security programs that reduce the risk of terrorism.  IACMS also enables IACs to obtain Security Threat Assessments (STAs) for their employees and agents, vetting individuals to reduce the threat of insiders introducing explosive or incendiary devices into commerce. KSMS vets shippers, reducing the likelihood that a shipper would introduce such a device.  FAS provides historical domestic and foreign air cargo screening data and is used by the TSA Cargo Targeting Unit (CTU) to manage time-sensitive data requests and identify high risk ports and entities via reliable risk data.
Primary benefits of this investment include improved oversight of regulated parties and shared security data (reducing costs and improving efficiency). By enhancing agent access to IACMS, deploying web services via KSMS, and automating manual processes via FAS, primary benefits include decreased time required for the vetting process, decreased transaction costs and processing times, decreased workload during the vetting process, increased data quality, and a reduction in the compliance burden by industry. Key internal stakeholders, customers, and beneficiaries include the Consolidated Screening Gateway (CSG), Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) Office, TSA Cargo Inspectors, and Principal Security Inspectors (previously known as Regional Compliance Coordinators).

As noted in the Air Cargo Final Rule (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-08-18/pdf/2011-20840.pdf) the main benefit of this approach is the improved security of the traveling public through reduction in the risk of an explosive or incendiary device being placed on an aircraft from the passenger air cargo mode, and an overall decrease in the risk of terrorism. It is difficult to determine how many planes would be destroyed by terrorism absent of the Air Cargo Security Program’s approach; however, the program can conservatively assume that its systems can help prevent a terrorist incident on 1 flight per year, saving 0.00000011% (1 flight/8,843,510 domestic flights in 2015 according to transtats.bts.gov) of the nation’s annual domestic flights from potential acts of terrorism. As a part of the final rule, TSA also estimated the cost of a terrorist incident to be $732.5M per incident. Air Cargo estimates the potential total cost avoidance to be $5.856B (1 incident x 8  years (total lifecycle) x $732.5M) and the program’s total cost avoidance to be $585.6M (conservatively allocating 10% of this total cost, as the program plays a portion of the nation’s layered approach to aviation security). Therefore the program calculates its return on investment (ROI) to be 1.31 ((Cost Avoidance/Risk Adjusted Total Lifecycle Cost of Program) -1). The $253.7M in Air Cargo Security program costs will be recovered and the program will then return $1.31 in terrorist incident avoidance costs for every dollar invested into the program.","Legislative Mandate- The Aviation Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandated that a system be in operation to screen, inspect, and ensure the security of all cargo that is to be transported in all-cargo aircraft as soon as practicable.  Additionally, the 9/11 Act mandated that TSA establish a system to screen 100% of cargo transported on passenger aircraft by August 2010. The Air Cargo Security investment consists of three systems that enable TSA to meet these statutory requirements. http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ71/html/PLAW-107publ71.htm 
Outstanding Audit Finding or Material Weakness- In the GAO-03-344 report, the GAO recommended that TSA develop a comprehensive plan for air cargo security that includes priority actions identified on the basis of risk, costs of these actions, deadlines for completing those actions, and performance targets.  As a result, the Air Cargo IT investments directly support the strategic plan and enable TSA to carry out the priority actions. In the GAO-06-76 report, the GAO found that the Known Shipper database’s effectiveness was limited and this limits TSA’s ability to identify shippers who may pose a security threat.  The report also recommended that the data used in the Freight Assessment System to identify elevated risk cargo are complete, accurate, and current. In the OIG-09-35 report, the OIG recommended to resolve all remaining KSMS technical problems in order to achieve a specific date for mandating regulated entities compliance with the new method.

The goal of SEVIS is to track information on nonimmigrants who are participating in the U.S. education system or designated exchange visitor program throughout the duration of their approved stay. Nonimmigrants may temporarily come to the US to study under three classes of admission: F for academic and language students, M for vocational students, and J for exchange visitors. SEVIS greatly improved efficiencies by using electronic means to capture critical F/M/J nonimmigrant information in a centralized repository. The use of the SEVIS electronic system increases data accuracy, reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information, improves the experience of school/program officials and nonimmigrants, and significantly increases data sharing across multiple government agencies reducing duplication of effort. Efficiencies are further improved through the ability of the web-based SEVIS application to be used in real-time for data updates and queries which reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information. SEVIS supports the DHS Mission by providing critical information needed to enforce immigration laws. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) within the ICE Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is the business sponsor that funds and manages SEVIS. SEVIS also supports the Department of State (DoS) Office of Private Sector Exchange in its mission. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides IT program and project management support to SEVP. Stakeholders include DHS ICE and DoS government users; customers are users from the academia and programs sponsoring F, M, or J status nonimmigrants; nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors and their dependents. In addition, SEVIS shares data with agencies’ and organizations’ systems including, DoS Consular Consolidated Database (CCD), USCIS Electronic Immigration System (ELIS), Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF), Department of Treasury I-901 Fee Pay system, Student and Exchange Visitor Program Automated Management System (SEVPAMS), CBP TECS, Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS).",024-048,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3255 - Goal 3.1:  Strengthen and Effectively Administer the Immigration System, 3260 - Goal 2.3:  Disrupt and Dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations and Other Illicit Actors, 30982 - Goal 3.2: Prevent Unlawful Immigration","During the life of SEVIS, enhancements have been made to help facilitate the process required for foreign students and scholars coming to the United States and to minimize a perception that the United States is discouraging foreign students and scholars from coming to the U.S. These enhancements include ensuring that data is accurate so nonimmigrants are not denied a visa or entry based on incorrect information and ensuring that there are processes to quickly correct inaccurate data. Government users have also come to recognize the value of SEVIS data. A primary example is the timely data that SEVIS provides CBP, which supports CBP officers at U.S. ports of entry in making information-based decisions on granting entry for F, M, and J nonimmigrants. For the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF) and the ICE Compliance Enforcement Unit (CEU), SEVIS has similarly become an essential tool for national security.","https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-act-2002

SEVIS supports the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. Legislative Mandates for SEVIS include the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 which directed the development and conduct of a program to collect certain information on nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors. Following the 9-11 attack Congress enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act). Section 416 mandated the full implementation of SEVIS by January 1, 2003. Congress enacted the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 in January 2003. This Act clarified procedures for collecting and managing information on nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 delegated responsibility of SEVIS to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and required that SEVIS information be used to carry out enforcement functions.

In 2006, the Homeland Security Council Policy Coordinating Committee (HSC PCC) reported on a variety of national security vulnerabilities related to the admission of nonimmigrant students, including several needed and at times critical SEVIS improvements. Concurrently, a data validation exercise made SEVP aware of some of the limitations in the data. In 2007, SEVP commissioned an independent study to evaluate the situation and identify possible remedies, one of which was the recommendation for a completely new system.",yes,yes,http://www.ice.gov/sevis/|https://sevis.ice.dhs.gov/sevis/,"Joseph Knarich","2 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-2)- Mid-Level",297.543,35.102,38.483,49.598,2002,2029,N/A.,2016-09-12,"Customer Results:
SEVIS is utilized as a critical national security database.  It originated as an immigration benefits tracking tool, but throughout its existence, it has been adapted to the ever-growing needs of its users.  It is now regarded as a primary resource for conducting threat analysis for counterterrorism and/or counterintelligence by the law enforcement and intelligence communities. 

Strategic and Business Results:
In response to the 14 February 2013 DHS Acquisition Decision Memorandum, SEVP and OCIO are jointly working on incremental improvements to SEVIS using an Agile implementation methodology. 35 functionalities were selected to help stabilize and partially mitigate known vulnerabilities to the system through standard O&M releases. The final release under this ADM was completed on 30 September 2016, at which point 75% of identified vulnerabilities had been closed. After the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, ICE committed to building an Admissibility Indicator service to enable CBP agents to quickly ascertain student visa status at primary inspection points. Efforts to migrate AI 1.6 to the AWS cloud are complete, and the module is in an O&M status. 
 
Financial Performance and Operational Performance Measures:
ICE provided DHS with documentation demonstrating that all the national security vulnerabilities in SEVIS cannot be remediated within the current system. OCAE agreed to request DHS allow ICE to develop a Mission Need Statement and an Analysis of Alternatives Study Plan. The results of the Analysis of Alternatives were confirmed by the SEVIS Modernization Oversight Board on 4 January 2016, and acquisition packages are currently being prepared in support of this modernization. On a ten-year lifecycle starting FY2017, the approved modernization alternative will cost approx. 20% more than the maintenance of the legacy O&M system, and yield a 90% increase in operational effectiveness. This yields a life-cycle ROI of 57%. As partof modernization, SEVIS will migrate fully to a cloud-hosted infrastructure in AWS, resulting in improved supportability and scalability while reducing overall infrastructure and maintenance costs.

Innovation and Risk Analysis:
All SEVIS development contracts are issued on a firm fixed-price basis, mandate Agile methodologies, and define limited-scope work, in order to effectively manage cost, schedule, and scope risks.",3,"The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) program is in the Mixed life cycle phase. The program continues to perform within acceptable OMB guidelines for cost and schedule variance. Since the last assessment, SEVIS met with the Acquisition Review Board (ARB) completing its first semi-annual program review for their post-Acquisition Decision Event (ADE)-2A/2B on March 31, 2017. During this review, ARB decided that SEVIS will devise a plan for the contractual award of an SEVIS modernization module by the end of 3QFY17. However, the program continued to experience delays with the Flexible Agile Support for the procurement contract award resulting in a cancellation. This cancellation will impact the program’s ability to reach Initial Operational Capability (IOC), and Full Operating Capability (FOC) on schedule. Additionally, it will impact the program cost, as it will require an extension of the legacy SEVIS contracts beyond the original sunset date. Due to this cancellation, the program is schedule to go back to the ARB in 4QFY17 to provide updates on contracting strategy and status of Testing and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) endorsement. Additionally, the program received a waiver to use Schedule 70 to procure agile services. Program leadership is assessing its modernization plans and schedule to determine the ultimate program risks while maintaining a moderate risk exposure. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Chief Information Officer (CIO) has downgraded the SEVIS program to a Medium Risk investment due to the recent delays and cancellation of the agile procurement contract.",Yellow,0,11,"Update Required",2018,"2009-06-30 00:00:00","2017-08-30 11:18:16","2009-06-30 00:00:00"

Among the alternatives analyzed, it provided the best return. This ROI indicates that external benefits will likely increase such that a portion of the acquisition costs will be recovered, although the program will not generate any additional “return? or cost savings. The other alternatives provided significantly fewer external benefits and thus reflect that very little, if any, acquisition costs will be recovered.
The ROI is negative because it represents an expansion of the existing TACCOM footprint where no sites or equipment exist. While additional O&M will be required to operate and maintain the added sites, there will be fewer site outages due to failing legacy equipment. Although the tradeoff is not sufficient to provide a positive ROI, it will somewhat decrease the O&M requirements.
This investment has significant benefits, both internal and external. TACCOM is a broad-reaching program that strategically supports a wide number of missions and goals, and its systems are integral to a wide number of missions and goals. The investment enhances ICE's TACCOM technology foundation, maximizes workforce productivity by providing expanded coverage and improved mobile command and control, and improves information sharing between ICE and CBP. 
The most important internal benefits are increased officer safety and enhanced mission effectiveness. Internal benefits include: improved delivery of secure voice traffic; improved access to TACCOM services; improved access to information; improved interoperability within ICE components, with DHS components, with other FSLTT entities; improved security; reduced risks; and provides options and the flexibility for capturing future opportunities to expand, upgrade, and/or link systems. 
External benefits include: coordinated efforts to remove individuals who pose a danger to public safety; improved public safety through critical infrastructure security and resilience; improved support to thepublic through the deployment of interoperable systems and equipment that ensure effective, unified incident response operations during disasters and emergencies; and improved public safety due to the ability of ICE agents to use the expanded systems to share real-time information and enable the LEOs to analyze, fuse, and disseminate information and analysis, thus improving the integration of intelligence and operational activities.","GAO and OIG audits provided the following specific requirements that are being addressed by this investment: (1) ICE has taken steps to upgrade tactical communications equipment and infrastructure, but could benefit by developing performance and program plans. ICE has taken some actions to modernize its tactical communications radio systems. However, ICE does not have a program plan to manage its portfolio of projects. By developing a program plan to guide ICE’s overall tactical communications modernization program, ICE could better manage its program and achieve its program goals. (2) Develop and implement a plan to address any skills gaps for ICE radio users related to understanding the upgraded radio systems to ensure more ICE radio users are able to effectively use their radios to accomplish the agency’s mission. Develop a mechanism to track training provided to ICE radio users to ensure that the agency can address ICE radio user training needs. (3) DHS is taking actions to improve tactical communications interoperability among DHS components and with other federal, state, and local agencies, but it is too soon to assess whether these actions will address the various challenges CBP and ICE face in achieving interoperability.

ACE delivers these capabilities in a secure, paper-free, web environment. ACE has fulfilled Executive Order 13659, which mandates the creation of a Single Window, known as the International Trade Data System (ITDS).  ACE is the system through which the Single Window is realized.  ACE/ITDS is the primary means by which agencies with trade-related responsibilities will receive from users the standard set of data and other relevant documentation required for the release of imported cargo and the clearance of cargo for export. These capabilities/mandates align to the DHS mission of Securing and Managing our Borders. 
 
A key goal of ACE is to replace two aging legacy systems, the Automated Commercial System (ACS) and the Automated Export System (AES). AES has already been successfully retired and it’s functionality subsumed by ACE in 2014. ACS will be retired by 3/2017. Building ACS functionality into ACE will decrease O&M costs by not having to maintain two systems.
 
ACE provides considerable benefits to its stakeholders. This includes the enhanced targeting of high-risk shipments and automation, enabling CBP to process cargo faster (savings of $5.3M thus far in FY16). Another benefit includes the ability for CBP to focus on border security tasks and inter-agency information sharing, resulting in a more efficient workflow and reduction in the cost of labor and paper intensive activities which are expensive. This produced a cost savings to the trade community of $10.9M thus far in FY16. ACE enables the Government and the private sector increased reporting accuracy and compliance with U.S. laws, promoting efficiency in Government and improved public service.

ACE’s key stakeholders are CBP, Partner Government Agencies (PGAs), and the Trade community. CBP includesborder and trade enforcement personnel who use ACE to process shipments arriving into the U.S. PGAs include 47 government agencies that have statutory relationships with CBP or the authority of cargo and/or a conveyance in an import or export transaction. Trade includes commercial entities that import/export and provide brokerage services to those importing/exporting goods into and out of the US.",024-043,"3259 - Goal 2.2:  Safeguard and Expedite Lawful Trade and Travel","The following is the explanation on ROI as stated in the attached AoA document: 
 
The Return On Investment (ROI) indicates the percent saved in future O&M dollars for every dollar spent on the initial investment. ROI is based on O&M savings in the following areas:  
·          Help desk support -Application, hardware and software maintenance
·          Data center labor
·          User Training and Materials
·          Security Testing  
·          Operational analyses due to lower usage of the mainframe platform  
·          Efficiencies from the CBP target architecture from getting off the mainframe
·          Reduced licensing costs  
·          Shared system components  
·          Standardizing certification and accreditation  
·          Improving scalability and reliability and instituting open standards.  
The benefits of modernizing to a more efficient electronic interface will enhance communications between CBP, PGAs, and the Trade Community. The improved communications will provide time savings for entry corrections and allow for more timely cargo processing. For example, the Document Imaging System (DIS) will enable paper forms to be received and processed electronically, providing more efficiency at the Port of Entry (POE) and saving time and money for the government and the Trade Community.  Ultimately the new functionality will free up more time for port personnel to perform mission work rather than clerical and administrative tasks.","Requirements for this investment include:
 
1) The delivery of ACE capabilities fulfills the Customs Modernization Act of 1993 by enabling CBP personnel and trade community users to electronically submit and retrieve trade data.  ACE is providing CBP personnel with enhanced automated tools and information to perform security and compliance targeting to decide which cargo poses a potential risk, and what cargo should be expedited because it complies with U.S. laws. SAFE Port Act of 2006 - directed that all agencies requiring documentation for clearing or licensing the importation and exportation of cargo participate in an interagency initiative to establish a single portal system known as the International Trade Data System. ACE is intended to facilitate the collection and distribution of standard electronic import and export data required by all Federal agencies participating in ITDS.

The program’s 2016 Risk Management plan has been attached to the Business Case. ACE ranks each risk by probability, and impact. Each risk includes a mitigation steps to close the risk. The program utilizes the 19 categories for risk as outlined by OMB Circular A-11. The ACE Risk Register has also been attached to this Business Case.",2,"The Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) program is in the Mixed life cycle phase.  The program has breached its Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) schedule threshold for Acquisition Decision Event (ADE) 3, originally scheduled for June 2017.  Integration testing of the program’s collections module has not proceeded as originally planned and requires further testing before these capabilities can be deployed.  Consequently, the program will not meet its adjusted July target date for its final core ACE deployment.  As a result of this delay, the planned September decommissioning date for the legacy system will also not be met, incurring additional unplanned costs.  This continued delay and maintenance of the legacy system will exacerbate the current funding shortfall that has caused the program to breach its APB acquisition cost threshold.  Program leadership has reached out to the Department for development support and has teams onsite to help with discovery.  ACE intends to decouple the collections module from the rest of the program and deploy the remainder of ACE while continuing to test collections.  The cost and schedule impact of delaying deployment is unknown at this time but has the potential to be substantial.

These capabilities have been leveraged and integrated to expand the capabilities to inbound pedestrian, outbound vehicle and pedestrian, and U.S. Border Patrol (BP) checkpoint processing; and improve existing primary processing operations.

LBI’s goals are to facilitate the flow of travelers into the U.S. in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to Secure and Manage Flows of People and Goods while minimizing disruption and facilitating safe and secure inbound and outbound legal flows of people and goods; increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of land border processing; and integrate data to support intelligence and targeting within the Land Border “Triangle?: inbound, checkpoint, and outbound.

Benefits include: vehicle (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without LBI technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes; reduced manual license plate corrections and fewer time and labor intensive secondary referrals. The reduced number of acceptable documents, and increased document security features make it easier for officers to identify fraudulent documents.  LBI extended benefits from initial inbound vehicle capabilities by ensuring that vehicle and document data can also be acquired when vehicles leave the U.S. (outbound) or travel within the U.S. interior (U.S. Border Patrol checkpoints).  LBI has also extended these benefits to travelers entering the U.S. on foot (pedestrians) and buses.

The beneficiaries are the traveling public and the governments of Canada, and Mexico and their citizens.  The original LBI  investment allowed CBP to address the requirements imposed by Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), Public Law 108-458), as amended, by June 1, 2009.  LBI capabilities add security and decrease inbound primary processing time, which reduces border wait time.",024-044,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","LBI provides technologies and infrastructure to improve border operation facilitation and security.   For inbound vehicle and pedestrian processing, RFID technologies, upgraded LPRs, an improved primary inspection application, direction variable message signage, traffic management devices, and policies like active lane management (ALM) expedite border crossing, more efficiently use scarce officer and infrastructure resources.  For example, the promotion of RFID technology and new RFID document options result in more efficient processing methods: vehicles (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without the RFID technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes.  The improved LPRs have reduced manual plate corrections by 10 million per year further reducing process time and improving security.  The benefits that accrue from the technical facilitation (RFID, LPR, VPC) of the crossing process are far reaching: increased throughput per officer, reduced border crossing wait time, and increased capacity to accommodate increases in border crossing volume.  Increased border crossing volume has a positive impact on the U.S. economy.  These capabilities also provide more enhanced information about travelers which improves border crossing security.  LBI ‘returns’ are calculated based on the difference in wait time prior to LBI compared to post LBI, and by estimating the value of that time for the traveling public.  The original WHTI Land Regulatory Analysis establish low, medium and high values ($ per hour) for both business and private travelers.  These value factors are multiplied by the net wait time differences to arrive at an estimated total return.  Therefore, the LBI Return on Investment (ROI) of 94.00 is calculated as the wait time traveler value minus the LBI investment (Acquisition and O&M) divided by the LBI investment.","The LBI investment was authorized by Congress to address the requirements imposed by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), Public Law 108-458), as amended.

Deployed technologies are reliable, fast, durable, and cost effective. Benefits to operations include both reduced process time and increased security.

Customer Results & Operational Performance: Regular reviews of LPR performance show they meet contractual service level requirements of 95% read accuracy. Benefits at POEs arise from innovative programs. Trusted Traveler programs provide a 74% shorter wait compared to general vehicle lanes and cycle times that are 57% faster (requiring fewer CBP officers). Ready Lane solutions shorten cycle times by 21% to 34% and reduce average waits up to 22% for inbound vehicles and pedestrians. Performance Metrics under program control are consistently met and those that rely on the traveling public are regularly met.

Strategic & Business Results: LBI supports officers tasked with deciding whether to admit, deny, or refer for further processing travelers who seek to enter the U.S. at a POE. LBI meets the regulatory needs of Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Public Law 108-458, as amended.

Financial Performance: LBI enhances inbound traveler processing; expedites and secures over 200 million inspections annually; and reduces border wait times. Mobile devices for outbound and checkpoint operation allow officers and agents to document inspections and conduct law enforcement queries at the point of interview reducing inspection costs.

Innovation: Active Lane Management, improved signage, and the use of Ready Lanes. Many-to-Many configured pedestrian kiosks allow multiple pedestrian queues to feed multiple inspection booths. Advances in biometric identification are being evaluated for inclusion in the technology solution. Handheld applications are being investigated to enable travelers to preprocess without officerinteraction or CBP-funded hardware and infrastructure.

Risk Analysis: LBI maintains an active Risk Register and meets on a regular basis to review risks. Each risk is assessed to determine if its likelihood of occurrence and impact are valid; if not information is updated. If a risk is on track to being realized it becomes an issue and mitigation is begun. New risks are identified and added to the register; resolved risks are cancelled.

The 3 phase implementation of SAP was completed in October of 2004. This effort was undertaken as a result of an analysis of legacy Customs Asset Management Processes and replaced numerous legacy financial, procurement, and property systems with a single, fully integrated solution.  SAP provides many benefits to CBP including: complete integration of business processes within one system, improved financial statement reporting and internal controls, reduced cycle-time, elimination of duplicate data entry, improved data accuracy, single system reporting, and enhanced analytical reporting. SAP ensures that CBP is in compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems. The system has dependencies to other CBP systems in the form of interfaces and data transfers that enable the accurate and complete recording of financial and associated transactions. Those systems include Concur Government Edition (CGE), Customs Overtime Scheduling System (COSS), and the CBP Automated Collection System (ACS) to name a few. SAP provides the financial, procurement, and asset tracking which allows CBP to accomplish its mission.  The SAP approach reduces functional gaps identified in past audits and raises performance to acceptable industry benchmarks.  The SAP Project is in a steady - state mode under the Investment Management Process. CBP is now state-of-the-art and has been identified as a leader in Financial Management by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  SAP supports QHSR Mission 2; Secure and Manage our Borders.  The SAP system must be maintained and supported so that CBP financial staff can meet their timelines and efficiency targets which help CBP to operate effectively.  Maintaining SAP will also help CBP continue receiving unqualified audit opinions.  The primary beneficiaries of the system include the over 6000 CBP field and headquarters role-based users as well as CBP and DHS management who utilize the data and information processed and reported on in SAP. Other stakeholders for the SAP program include the Office of Finance and the Office of Information Technology as co-sponsors of the program; as well as others who rely on accurate financial data from CBP.",000-000,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","SAP is an integrated resource planning (ERP) system that replaced ten stove-piped, outdated, and underperforming mainframe systems that resulted in audit findings of significant internal control weaknesses and were deemed insufficient and no longer suited to meeting data processing and reporting needs.  SAP adequately addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  The elimination of duplicate entry manual processes in both asset and financial management have created significant cost savings.  The QPAM analysis in 1999 found that implementation of an ERP system would generate the following reductions in government labor related to asset and financial management:  Planning reduced by 38%, Budgeting by 8.6%, Acquisition by 27.4%, Pay and Expend by 50%, and Monitor and Control would be reduced by 46%.  
SAP continues to be a good investment for CBP and the federal government.  In FY2015 with over $12 billion in budgetary resources, CBP collected over $41 billion in revenue and managed $16.2 billion in assets.  As an integrated ERP system, SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting.  CBP has received an unqualified opinion on stand-alone audits each year since 1996, running on SAP since 2004. 
Additionally, the SAP program measures program performance annually via the Operational Analysis covering the following areas:  Customer Results, Strategic and Business results, Financial Performance, Innovation, Performance Measure Results, and Risk Assessment. 
Based on the Office of Finance Customer Satisfaction Survey in May 2016 the SAP Overall Average Satisfaction Rating remained consistently high at 4.08 out of a possible 5.0 across all components.  The Technical Performance Analysis of SAP shows the system availability is above 98% for the 2016 fiscal year to date.  The Strategic and Business/Mission Analysis shows the many benefits SAP provides to CBP/DHS including:  complete integration of business processes within one system; improved financial statement reporting and internal controls; reduced cycle-time; elimination of duplicate entry; improved data accuracy; single system reporting; enhanced analytical reporting; and compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems.","There are several specific requirements currently for the SAP Program. Three legislative mandates exist that are being implemented to satisfy these requirements. The Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) is a project of the DHS Unity of Effort Initiative. The goal of the CAS is to standardize appropriations across DHS, increasing comparability and transparency and enhancing strategic decision making.  The new structure is being met and is scheduled to begin with the FY17 appropriation.  Additional information on CAS can be found here:  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DMO%20(Departmental%20Management%20and%20Operations)%20-%20OCFO%20-%20A%20Common%20Appropriations%20Structure%20for%20DHS%20-%20FY%202016%20Crosswalk.pdf
In May 2014, President Obama signed the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) (P.L. 113-101) into law. Once implemented, the DATA Act will make Federal spending data more accessible, searchable, and reliable. It will not only make it easier to understand how the Federal government spends taxpayer dollars but will also serve as a tool for better oversight, data-centric decision-making, and innovation both inside and outside of government. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are leading the government-wide implementation of the DATA Act.  The DATA Act project will be complete in October 2016.  For more information on the DATA Act follow this link:  https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/data-act.aspx
The third mandate is for the Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID).  The requirement from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) states “Agencies shall have in place a process that ensures that each PIID used to identify a solicitation or contract action is unique Government-wide, and will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of the contract award.?  This project is scheduled for completion in FY2017 and will satisfy the requirement.  Additional information on this mandate can be found in the FAR in Subpart 4.16 sections (4.1601, 4.1602, 4.1603) https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/pdf/FAR.pdf.

It is used to review air, sea, train, and limited bus passengers and crew in an effort to identify possible terrorists, uncover high-risk individuals, and facilitate the clearance process for legitimate travelers. 
 
The goal of APIS is to facilitate clearance of valid travelers, who are not appearing on watch lists. Commercial/private carriers and aircraft provide APIS information from the biographic information found in the travel documents before traveler boarding of commercial/private vessels and aircraft. The information is then transmitted to CBP prior to departure. It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. 
 
Current benefits of APIS includes matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance. APIS currently collects inbound and outbound data for air and sea passengers; converts to World Customs Organization standards to transmit and acquire data; processes Canadian and Mexican APIS data for passengers traveling from overseas. eAPIS and eNOA/D are web-based functions that allow air carriers and vessels operating without advance departure control systems to transmit data electronically to CBP. Small/medium air carriers can upload data to CBP, acknowledge receipt of data to carriers, and allow carriers to view and request performance reports.
 
APIS supports mission delivery by screening the information against law enforcement databases containing “lookout? records from many agencies and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify travelers who are a threat to national security and should not be allowed to travel, andtarget travelers who need additional inspection upon arrival at a Port of Entry.

The program is not required to complete a Cost Benefit Analysis.  APIS was granted a waiver from Under Secretary for Management Mr. Raphael Boras in 2013 (ADM attached in documents).

Benefits provided by APIS to both internal and external to the government cannot be easily quantified. In terms of internal benefits, APIS has proven to be exceptionally valuable and useful.  It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. APIS data is critical to CBP biographical entry/exit systems.  APIS is the single best method by which CBP obtains advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  The apprehension of the Times Square Bomber is the most visible recent example in that APIS alerted CBP that the bomber was attempting to flee the country and where he could be apprehended.

The computerized analysis of inbound and outbound passengers dramatically increases the efficiency of analysis of high risk traveler identification, as well as, facilitation of low risk passenger traffic. Within the APIS, the development of the eAPIS automated report generation module has significantly reduced the time Account Managers spend on processing APIS sufficiency reports.","APIS fulfilled the mission needs outlined in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, The Acts require commercial air and sea carriers to electronically transmit arrival and departure manifests for each commercial vessel or aircraft prior to arrival at or departure from the US. This includes matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance. APIS supports mission delivery by screening the information against law enforcement databases containing “lookout? records from many agencies and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify travelers who are a threat to national security and should not be allowed to travel, and target travelers who need additional inspection upon arrival at a Port of Entry. APIS facilitates clearance of valid travelers, i.e., those not appearing on watch lists. APIS is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various Watch Lists.

APIS’s aligns to the QHSR (Quadrennial Homeland Security Review) 2.1 goal to Secure US Air, Land and Sea Boarders and Approaches.

The goal of the Program is to procure, deploy and maintain effective interdiction and detection technology, at each inspection point, to enable CBP’s border security mission without impact to legitimate trade and traffic. Current priorities of the program are (1) continue to deploy technology to support POE expansion and reconfigurations, (2) sustain interdiction & detection capability through recapitalization, and (3) deploy technology that promotes automation, integration, and agility across border security operations. Program benefits include contributions to border security and supply-chain security missions. As of 9/30/16 CBP has conducted over 85 million exams, resulting in more than 18,400 narcotics seizures, with a total weight of more than 4.1 million pounds, and more than $80.3 million in currency seizures. These systems are viewed as force multipliers, with tremendous economic impact. For example, the average NII system examination of a cargo container takes approximately 8 minutes, while a manual inspection takes, on average, 2 hours. This approach expedites trade without sacrificing security, while also minimizing costs. CBP estimates that NII technology provides an annual workforce saving/avoidance of approximately 7,000+ additional CBP officers. Key customers of the Program are CBP Field Offices and the CBP frontline officers and Border Patrol agents who operate the NII technologies. Key stakeholders of the Program include Congressional Committees with a focus on, but not limited to, Homeland/Transportation/Border/Maritime Security and Appropriations; OMB; DHS - Science & Technology, U.S. Coast Guard, and CBP; General Services Administration; Port Authorities and Terminal Operators; and original equipment manufacturers and service support providers of NII technologies. Other beneficiaries include U.S. citizens; individuals traveling to the U.S.; R&D communities seeking to advance imaging and detection capabilities; and international communities with similar inspection and detection technology or operations.",024-042,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","The calculated ROI for the NII program shows a net return of 123.4% based on a net present value (NPV) analysis. The NII Program provides internal and external benefits that are quantified and used to calculate the ROI.  Internally, NII systems reduce the time to conduct a manual exam by over 93 percent; an NII exam takes 8 minutes and a manual exam takes 120 minutes. To quantify this reduction - 23.1 million vessel and truck containers with a market value of $1.4 trillion entered the United States at and between POEs in FY 2015. Of these containers, NII large-scale technology inspected approximately 9 percent of the targeted vessel and truck containers (2 million of 23.1 million). Without using NII technology, the same number of exams would take an additional 3.8 million man-hours or approximately 7,000 additional CBP officers. NII systems also provide operational benefits spanning personnel safety, speed, and accuracy of detection. 
  
From an external perspective, the expedited inspection process - made possible with NII technologies - saves the trade industry an estimated 0.5-percent to 1.5-percent increase to the cost of goods that would be created if manual inspections were performed. This is cost avoidance to the trade industry of approximately $5.8 billion to $17.5 billion per year. This cost is based on a parametric estimate using current literature on the cost of transit time for the delivery of goods. While NII technology offers exceptional deterrence benefits at and between the Nation’s POEs, the greatest qualitative external benefit of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism. Through the use of NII equipment CBP has increased the number of and the quality of cargo inspections which decreases the probability that WMD or other instruments of terrorism will enter the U.S.","The Program will provide efficient and effective technological capabilities to interdict and detect illegal weapons, contraband and people arriving at the U.S. borders without affecting trade or travel.

Financial Performance: Cost/schedule variance did not exceed +/-10% when compared to the approved baseline. A mandated capabilities analysis is underway to reassess future requirements.  A staffing assessment concluded a FTE level of 54 positions is needed for the Program - a gap of 24 positions from the current level.  This is impacting efficient execution of the Program’s goals and is recognized as a program risk and reported in the Risk register.
Customer Results: NII equipment needs are being met but the general perception is more equipment is needed and some equipment is underperforming due to aging. Multi-year funding would let the Program be more agile and efficient to meet equipment needs. The rail environment is a prime candidate for adoption of integrated passive radiation and active x-ray NII technology.  Customer results, in general, agree with the benefits identified in the AA/CBA.
Business and Strategic Analysis: Without NII systems, CBP officers would face a massive challenge to physically inspect high-risk cargos to ensure threats do not enter the U.S.  The Program meets the requirements imposed by statues/directives and provides essential support to DHS and CBP strategic goals and is a critical component of CBP’s layered enforcement strategy.
Operational Performance Measures: Performance metrics are identified in the Program’s Business Case and updated annually - all metrics were met. CBP is pursuing initiatives to help mitigate the difference between budget and the LCCE. 
Innovation: The Program had 313 large-scale and 3,973 small-scale pieces of NII technology deployed at the start of FY15. DME plans include adding 29 large-scale and 1,482 small-scale pieces of technology to reach FOC by FY24. Because of the enhancement to be gained from replacement technology, the acquisition of replacement systems is included in the DME lifecycle phase.Innovation initiatives and milestones have been identified for CY16 and beyond and R&D efforts that may lead to enhanced inspection alternatives are being tracked.
Risk Analysis: The Program has one project in addition to the overall program.  That project is: NII Acquisitions FY15 consisting of multiple acquisitions. There are three risks specific to that project. Program risks are reported in the Risk Register and are consistent with the risks reported in the Business Case Investment Risk Table.",4,"The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) Systems Program is in the Mixed life cycle phase. The goal of the NII is to replace the aging fleet of equipment when it reaches the estimated end of useful/operational life and provide new equipment to fill requirements for new and expanded points of entry. A Capability Analysis Report (CAR) was completed and validated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Joint Requirements Council (JRC) in 2QFY17. The CAR addresses the necessary capabilities, associated gaps and recommended non-materiel or materiel solution approaches to support CBP’s future NII requirements. NII continues to meet or exceed the operational availability performance targets of small- and large-scale systems. The program is also on pace to maintain the prior year’s number of contraband seizures. NII is well-managed and exercises mature risk management; risks affecting cost, schedule, and performance are well-known. Emphasis is placed on monitoring and controlling the environment and factors that pose risks so that risk probabilities and impacts are minimized. A staffing assessment concluded a gap in level of adequate personnel. To the extent possible, the program continues to acquire contract staff for acquisition and deployment activities that are not inherently governmental. Government and contract personnel adjust workload and priorities to minimize negative impacts in the short-term while long-term solutions are sought. NII participation in the 1QFY17 CBP semi-annual portfolio review was rescheduled for 3QFY17.

ATS is a web-based enforcement and decision support tool that uses intelligence info and technology to target suspect inbound and outbound shipments for exams and passengers for inspection. ATS allows CBP officers to focus their efforts on cargo shipments and passengers consistent with current threats. ATS standardizes names, addresses, ship names, and similar data so these data elements can be more easily associated with other business data to form a more complete picture of passengers, imports and/or exports in context with previous behavior of the parties involved. Every passenger and shipment processed through ATS is subject to a real-time risk evaluation. Risk assessment strategies are multi-tiered in their approach and are founded on complex statistical studies, data analyses, and rules based on knowledge engineering. ATS goals are to serve the DHS Mission of Secure and Manage our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts continues to provide significant benefit to the public. ATS provides selectivity and target capability to support CBP inspection and enforcement activities. As volumes of data increase in people, cargo, and conveyances, officers require increasingly efficient access to more relevant real-time info on which to base critical admission decisions.  The ATS systems address data quality improvements to ensure efforts are focused on only those persons and cargo that present most probable threats to the homeland.  The beneficiaries and key customers of ATS are: CBP Officers and Analysts, the CBP National Targeting Center, CBP Office of Field Operations, CBP Office of International Trade, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Public. Stakeholders include: DHS/CBP (OFO and OIT). ATS utilizes information received from TECS, APIS, and other systems identified in the Enterprise Architecture tab. ATS analyzes over 17M transactions per day for potential threats.  Total ATS passengers and cargo systems maintain 99% uptimes.  Additionally, ATS scans over 150 million Air, Ocean, Rail, Truck, and Auto shipments for potential threats. Continued in comments section below.",024-041,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","ATS continues to provide a significant ROI by streamlining the processing of passengers and cargo while increasing the likelihood of identifying threats to the Homeland (e.g., narcotics or weapons). ATS has no DME funding and has been operational since 2004. ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by providing risk data on passengers and cargo. Hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and passengers provide officers and agents valuable info for a potential action. This is an invaluable resource capability. ATS also continues to provide quality data by working with other government agencies to eliminate derogatory matches and potential threats that are deemed false positives. ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characteristics provide information that assists in better targeting efforts.   
   
ATS benefits can be described through the# of persons denied boarding pre-departure 4,213 from October 2015 – March 2016 [FSA2] and cargo that is not allowed into the U.S. Another example is the SAS model within ATS which captured over $73,41,097 million dollars (street value) worth of Cocaine, Heroin, Meth, and Marijuana from October 2015 - August 2016.  This serves as evidence for senior leadership's review of the Southwest Border Counter Narcotics Strategy.  
    
ATS serves DHS Mission of Securing and Managing our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a significant benefit to the public. ATS helps secure lawful trade and travel which is vital for national security and public safety.  Governmentally, ATS utilizes system engineering techniques to maintain a system of systems capability throughout its components. ATS provides stakeholdersvaluable information to target and capture potential threats. ATS is used as a source system to target threats and provide the useful information to boots on the ground teams that can then make an informed decision on a passenger or cargo event. Users receive critical information from hotlists produced on individuals and cargo that present targeted threats to the homeland.","ATS aligns with the QHSR goals: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security and Secure and Manage Our Borders.  ATS provides critical targeting capabilities that allow targeters in the field to evaluate threats at a much faster rate and interdict when applicable.  This provides additional security and prevention of potential terrorist activity at the border and ports of entry.  ATS’s predictive models deliver machine learning and faster analysis of critical intelligence information.  Additionally, passenger and cargo targeting efforts have been augmented with several name matching algorithms that reduce the number of false positives. This also reduces the amount of time for vetting thus saving analysts’ time and allowing them to focus efforts on more critical threats.  This helps to better secure the US borders.

AFI has evolved into a data analysis and intelligence product creation and dissemination platform that supports multiple DHS components, specifically CBP and ICE.  AFI's goal is to provide technology and tools that produce timely and actionable intelligence for DHS personnel protecting our borders, enhances collaboration across DHS intelligence analysts in a shared workspace, and more effectively shares threat information and intelligence to other Federal partners charged with securing our nation. AFI benefits  include shorter time and expense in disseminating intelligence products to intelligence analysts in the field because reports are posted in a main repository and distributed to pre-identified communities. AFI serves as the one-stop shop for CBP and ICE-produced intelligence products with access available to intelligence organizations throughout DHS. AFI leverages existing legacy systems and provides an enhanced query, analysis, production, collaboration, and dissemination tool.  AFI provides an automated function that integrates information from multiple systems into a single platform that reduces manual effort and saves users valuable time.

This is primarily driven by  two quantifiable benefits: cost savings/cost avoidance, and services/products delivered to internal customers.  The first benefit derives from the value of not hiring additional intelligence analysts over the number required for AFI. The second benefit denotes the projected value of intelligence products created in AFI.  The AFI program creates efficiencies in collating and disseminating intelligence products, allowing for increased effectiveness and efficiency for CBP officers, Border Patrol and Air and Marine agents in utilizing strategic and practical intelligence at and between ports of entry.  AFI also includes non-quantifiable benefits.  Other benefits are positive contributions of the AFI program that cannot readily be categorized numerically, such as improving identification and targeting of potential terrorists and terrorist weapons through risk management and automated advanced and enhanced information, and preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States at ports of entry. The AFI program has led to the phase out of ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HIS) Fusion Program on September 2012 to promote cost saving measures and efficiency. Cost savings associated with the conversion to AFI equals about 1.85 million a year. AFI takes into consideration the projected value of benefits, new and previous O&M costs, and capital investment costs.

Block 1 supports U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents and officers to effectively detect, identify, classify and resolve illegal incursions at the border. 

The goal of the Block 1 System is to improve the U.S. Border Patrol's (USBP) ability to detect, identify, and classify incursions at the border.
 
The Block 1 system provides improved safety benefits to USBP by providing better tactical advantages through: over-watch capabilities, which use geo-positioning information with visual verification of agent locations relative to threats; improved geo-synchronization actions for risk reduction through the use of landmarks and terrain references on the common operating picture (COP); geo-spatial tracking; visual verification; real time information on specific threats; and increased visual coverage through the use of sensors.  
  
The system contributes to mission delivery by providing technological tools throughout CBP, but specifically allows USBP to focus efforts border security and enforcement resources in areas other than Tucson and AJO, Arizona. This provides flexibility in deploying assets and personnel throughout the central and eastern Arizona region. The system has improved USBP's situational awareness of illegal cross-border activity, leading to increased narcotic seizures and apprehensions of undocumented aliens. There were approximately 2,338 apprehensions and approximately 152, 204 pounds of marijuana seized from Mar 2015 to Mar 2016. 
  
The USBP is the key customer of the Block 1 system and primary stakeholder. Other stakeholders include: the Office of Field Operations (OFO), which houses the detainees; the Office of Air & Marine (AMO), which provides aerial assistance with the apprehensions; and the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) and Facilities Management and Engineering (FM&E). The Block 1 program office interfaces with additional external stakeholders, including: industry (repair/support services contractors), public property custodians (Pima County Counsel and state, local and tribal governments).

The primary beneficiaries are US citizens that own land on the border and citizens that frequent the national parks within the Tucson sector.",024-042,"3255 - Goal 3.1:  Strengthen and Effectively Administer the Immigration System, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","A traditional return on investment calculation for Block 1 is difficult to quantify given there is no means to measure “return? in terms of dollars for a system that produces increased situational awareness for USBP that results in increased apprehensions and drug seizures along the 53 mile section of the Arizona border with Mexico. Moreover, prior to the Block 1 system deployment, USBP did not possess a capability to accurately determine the amount of illegal traffic in the area currently covered by the Block 1 system. The ROI calculation shows -90% for the expected useful life of the Block 1 system. 

Compared to the baseline operating costs from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the operating costs for Block 1 system are estimated to be considerably lower. ROI was calculated by (Operating Costs without Block 1 - Operating Costs with Block 1) divided by the Capital Investment costs, providing the same level of surveillance. The internal benefit of improved situational awareness on the Arizona border has increased USBP’s ability to execute its mission elements and processes. These elements/processes include: predict, deter, detect, identify, classify, track, respond, and resolve. The Block 1 system integrates multiple sensor outputs into one COP and provides USBP with persistent coverage within the Block 1 sensor viewsheds (see definition – Supporting Comments). In addition, these sensors are able to provide USBP Agents with an increased visual coverage area and more opportunities for early identification and classification. 

Another internal benefit includes improving officer safety via providing BP with tactical advantages. The Block 1 system is able to provide the Border Patrol with better tactical advantages through: over watch capabilities which use geo-positioning information with visual verification of Agent locations relative to threats; better geo-synchronization actions for risk reduction through the use of landmarks and terrain references on the COP; geo-spatial tracking; visual verification; real time information on specific threats; and increased visual coverage through the use of sensors. 

Benefits external to the government include landowners within the Block 1 system coverage that have fewer claims from damaged fences and overall fewer property thefts. This also applies to citizen use of national wildlife refuges within the Block 1 system.","There are no legislative mandates, outstanding audit findings/material weaknesses, or Presidential Directives for the Block 1 investment.",no,yes,,"Karen Champaign","2 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-2)- Mid-Level",99.519,17.192,17.155,13.689,2011,2022,"The funding levels did not involve any significant changes.",2016-09-27,"The Block 1 system is a maturing system in operations and maintenance with an additional year of sustainment knowledge and continues to serve as an essential component in CBP’s arsenal to protect the nation’s borders.  
 
Strategic/Business: Block 1 met or exceeded strategic and business objectives for the PY. Block 1 succeeds in its mission to enable USBP agents to effectively detect, identify, classify, and resolve illegal incursions across the 53 miles of international border in Arizona by leveraging the suite of integrated day and night cameras, radars, unattended ground sensors, and a communications package. 

Customer satisfaction remains above average, operational performance remains steady and above the objectives with little variance in cost. Schedule delays have occurred with technical refresh activities due to shifting priorities and complex obsolescence issues. The system supports increased situational awareness, increased officer safety, improved operational effectiveness, decreased smuggling activity, fewer migrant deaths, and provides a manpower force multiplier.
 
Financial performance: The Block 1 Program Office has focused on reducing annual sustainment costs while not jeopardizing the operational performance of the system by transitioning logistics elements from contractor maintenance logistics support (CMLS) to organic Government support. 
 
Innovation: The Block 1 investment continued to explore opportunities to provide innovative approaches to border security. In collaboration with the Office of Information and Technology (OIT), the Block 1 PM is investigating the potential of integrating the Block 1 NOC/SOC within the OIT infrastructure.
 
Operational Performance Measures: The Block 1 system fell short of meeting the overall Operational Availability target of 95%, achieving an average availability of 93% in FY2016. The root cause of this shortfall is ongoing obsolescence and inoperability issues, and the Program Manager has implemented corrective actions to address the identified issues. 
 
Risk Analysis: The Block 1 PM maintains a Risk Management Plan that follows DHS/OMB best practices, including direction on how the program prioritizes and determines impact of risk and maintaining consistent mitigation strategies.

Nonetheless, an ROI calculation was developed based on operating assumptions (i.e., status quo of an average of one Border Patrol agent per mile of border versus 12 full-time MSCs).  The ROI calculates the Base Case Operations and Maintenance (O&M) minus the New Program O&M (plus other benefits) and then dividing the value by the Planning, Initial Capital, and Non-Recurring (i.e., new program non-O&M or new investment) costs and then subtracting 1.  This calculates the value as a percentage.  There is a high cost for the status quo, and the MSC system requires a relatively low capital investment, resulting in a high ROI.  The purpose of the investment is to increase the probability of apprehension in an effort to reduce cross border crime.  Internal benefits are the increased probability of detection which increases the costs of attempting to enter the U.S. illegally, thereby reducing the illicit flows and crimes associated with smuggling at and between ports of entry.  U.S. border threats are opportunistic, adaptive and continuously probing to exploit any new or existing weaknesses observed, and they have near real-time situational awareness of USBP activities through the use of a vast network of scouts on both sides of the border.  MSC systems, with their mobile capabilities, can respond to threats in multiple areas, and can be fielded in the areas with the highest threats.  This mobile response capability is flexible; it can be adjusted to changes in IoI patterns.  In addition, MSC systems can be used to augment existing systems or substitute for currently deployed technology that is temporarily non-operational.  An external benefit is the deterrence effect of a deployedMSC.  The presence of an MSC can provide sufficient deterrence that IoIs choose alternative border crossings, reducing the impacts to the local MSC deployment area.

Respondents agreed that the radar’s coverage provides sufficient situational awareness and commented that it is an improvement over the MSS. However, some respondents commented that there are still times when the MSC does not respond to known IoI activity. 
Strategic and Business Results:  The MSC is a critical element to the Arizona Technology Plan which incorporates the use of mobile and fixed assets in support of border security. MSC directly supports the Secure Fence Act of 2006.  The MSC program is the successor to the Mobile Surveillance System (MSS) and improves MSS capabilities through enhanced technologies.
Financial Performance:  The MSC investment continued to meet financial performance targets during the PY. Key stakeholders include US Border Patrol (USBP) and the CBP Office of Acquisition (OA).  The MSC program is leveraging internal maintenance support from the Office of Information & Technology (OIT). Analysis was conducted in support of a new FLIR contract action. This analysis was used to determine the required federal and contract FTEs in support of Contractor Maintenance Logistics Support (CMLS) and Contractor Depot Logistics Support (CDLS).
Innovation: In order to mitigate existing issues, research is being done to find improvements for vehicle tire maintenance and electronic data tracking/reporting. The team is exploring the following opportunities:
 - Foliage Penetrating (FOPEN) Radar to improve the radar functionality in locations with dense vegetation
 - Electronic Shift Reporting to improve data reporting and tracking for maintenance and operations
 - Perimeter Detection System to provide enhanced detection capabilities for the Tucson Sector
Operational Performance Measures: 
 - MSC performance is an improvement from the MSS
 - MSC radar exceeds the performance of any other mobile system’s radar
 - MSC mobility enables deployments to remote and rugged terrain
 - Operator workspace is comfortable and adequate to perform mission functions

The goal of the NB RVSS program is to provide persistent ground and maritime surveillance needed by Border Patrol agents to effectively deter, detect, track, identify, classify, and respond to items of interest throughout the respective Area of Responsibility (AOR).  The investment continues to operate and maintain the NB RVSS located in Buffalo, NY and Detroit, MI. The NB RVSS towers have expanded the coverage on the northern border where high threat areas exist. The NB RVSS supports the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review by specifically supporting the security mission to Secure and Manage Our Borders.
 
The deployed system covers over 20 miles in Buffalo Sector on the Lower Niagara River and 65 miles in Detroit Sector spanning the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River for a total of 85  miles of maritime border with the RVSS capability. According to ROI figures calculated below, NB RVSS reduces the need for approximately 50 agents covering the same area of the border. The deployed systems serve as force multipliers enabling CBP officers to effectively monitor the vast and complex border. The NBRVSS's ROI has achieved several quantitative benefits that are internal and external to the government:  
 
1. Over 85 miles of surveillance coverage along the northern border: 65 miles in Detroit Sector spanning the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River, 20 miles in Buffalo Sector on the Lower Niagara River. 
2. Increased situational awareness through the deployment of RVSS in the northern border. 
3. The all-weather system is available for use and maintained an Operational Availability for over 4 years greater than 95%. 
 
The NB RVSS systems support the DHS mission to improve upon border security, to exclude terrorist threats, drug traffickers, and other threats to national security, economic security, and public safety. The key customer and primary stakeholder of this capability is the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP); other stakeholders/beneficiaries are the Office of Field Operations (OFO), Air and Marine Operations(AMO), Office of Intelligence (OI), and US Coast Guard (USCG), and federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.",024-042,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","The Northern Border Remote Video Surveillance System (NB RVSS) investment's return on investment has achieved several quantitative benefits internal and external to the government: 
1. There are approximately 85 miles of surveillance coverage in the northern border with this investment, which provides increased situational awareness through the deployment of RVSS in the northern border.  
2. The system is available for use and operating dependably 96% of the time.
To further define the basis for the ROI, an ROI document was developed and updated July 2016. This ROI Memo is attached the Key Documents section in INVEST. 
The ROI computation of 123% was obtained using the following formula: 
ROI = (((Baseline Cost – Program O&M1 Cost) / (Project Initial Capital Cost))-1)*100%. Baseline cost was calculated based on northern border staffing levels of 2,200 Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) and 4,000 miles of northern border, resulting in an average of 0.55 agents per mile of border (2,200/4,000 = 0.55). 85 miles of NB RVSS coverage multiplied by average agent per mile of .55 results in 46.75 FTEs. The NB RVSS system allows 46.75 BPAs to focus on other USBP (United States Border Patrol) law enforcement priorities. The RVSS has removed a significant amount of human element to monitoring the border, thus allowing agents to be deployed into unmonitored areas to the north instead of concentrating all manpower and resources around the water border.

The ROI has increased 23% since last year due to a projected extension in lifecycle of the investment to 2022. This ROI increases every year the system stays deployed as the baseline costs exceed the O&M cost of the system. More specifically, due to capital investment staying constant, the increase in life-cycle duration has greatly increased the return on the investment.
 
In addition to the cost savings associated with the reduced number of BPAs, NB RVSS’ video storage capability contributes significantly toUSBP investigations and indictments of illegals across the Northern Border.","NBRVSS supports the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review.

ROI was calculated as follows: Operating Costs without RVSS - Operating Costs with RVSS)/Capital Investment costs.

Internal Benefits: The RVSS Upgrade benefits U.S. Border Patrol operations through visual surveillance to facilitate apprehension of illegal intruders across U.S. borders, improved performance (detection and identification) of U.S. borders, addressing obsolescence issues of the legacy RVSS, and enhancing agent safety in comparison to the legacy system. Other benefits include technology upgrades, communication backhaul upgrades, command and control room modifications, physical security, and power upgrades for existing and new RVSS towers. The RVSS system will provide the Border Patrol with a persistent surveillance capabilities, which will enable them to detect, identify, and track Items of Interest (IoI).

Benefits External to the Government: The RVSS upgrade program could result in indirect and long-term beneficial impacts by reducing the adverse impacts of illegal cross-border violator activities in the project area.  The RVSS towers would enhance CBP’s detection and threat classification capabilities and increase the efficiency of operational activities within the area of tower coverage.  Over time the enhancement of detection capabilities and an increase in operational efficiency could increase the deterrence of illegal cross-border violator activity within the area of tower coverage.

Outstanding Audit Finding or Material Weakness: GAO reported in March 2014 and April 2015 that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), had made progress in deploying programs under the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan (the Plan), but could take additional actions to strengthen its management of the Plan and its related programs. Specifically, in March 2014 GAO reported that CBP's schedules and life-cycle cost estimates for the Plan and its three highest-cost programs—which represented 97 percent of the Plan's total estimated cost—met some but not all best practices. GAO recommended that CBP ensure that its schedules and cost estimates more fully address best practices, such as validating cost estimates with independent estimates, and DHS concurred. As of May 2016, CBP has initiated or completed deployment of technology for each of the three highest-cost programs under the Plan, and reported updating some program schedules and cost estimates (Link: http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-671T).",no,yes,,"Michael B.

TARS provides surveillance data to the CBP Office of Air and Marine (OAM) Operations Center (AMOC). TARS is an aerostat-borne surveillance system that is utilized by CBP's Air & Marine branch as its primary tool to identify and track suspect targets. Radar information from TARS is distributed to multiple operations centers run by CBP, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Department of Defense (DOD). As a secondary mission, TARS supports the United States Northern Command’s (USNORTHCOM’s) and the United States Southern Command’s (USSOUTHCOM’s) air surveillance mission. In addition, TARS surveillance data also supports North American Aerospace Defense Command’s (NORAD’s) air sovereignty mission for the Continental United States.  

The strategic goal is to support the DHS QHSR mission 2, Secure and Manage Our Borders. TARS also strives to assist CBP to consistently detect, identify and classify illegal entries and determine the level of threat involved.  

Benefits include a unique look-down radar capability that allows CBP to detect aircraft that would not be detected through a ground based system due to its low altitude and/or terrain masking limitations. While operating at 10,000 feet, the TARS radar has been optimized to detect low (0 - 2,000 feet above sea level) and slow (0 - 1,000 knots) aircraft at a range of 200 nautical miles.

ADIS accomplishes this by matching automated entry & exit records of foreign nationals into a consolidated travel history, and provide biographic identity & overstay status services to customers & stakeholders. ADIS’ goals to prevent illegal entry, exit, and overstay directly support the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review’s Mission Goals 2.1 Effective Control of U.S. Air, Land, Sea Borders and Approaches, 2.2 Safeguard Lawful Trade and Travel, and 3.2 Prevent Unlawful Immigration. ADIS collects & maintains arrival/departure information on non-US citizens traveling to the US, and matches this information to a person, thereby creating a complete person-centric record of events compliant with visa admissibility & issuance provisions. 

ADIS benefits include assistance in determining admissibility, law enforcement action, Visa approval/denial and Visa Waiver Program eligibility. Investment benefits users by matching travel events with changes in immigration status to provide an overstay status. Benefits also include support for anticipated immigration reform & expansion of biographic & biometric exit activities. ADIS contributes to DHS Missions 2 Secure & Manage Our Borders and 3 Enforce and Administer Our Immigration Laws by looking at arrival & departure data collectively from multiple sources to determine whether a person departed the US on time or if they legally extended their immigration status. 

Internal DHS customers, who are also stakeholders, are CBP, OBIM, ICE, USCIS, TSA, & USCG. External customers, who are also stakeholders, include Department of State (DOS) and the intelligence community. ADIS incorporates data elements & transactions associated with CBP systems & other immigration systems to create & maintain complete histories on about 330M travelers & processes more than 2.6M transactions a day. ADIS services are growing in usageand includes a 24/7 help desk, and system uptime of 98% or greater. ADIS enables DHS to comply with Congressional, legislative, operational, and executive mandates by helping to determine if foreign nationals have overstayed terms of admission; enhances homeland security by providing a cost-effective response to the entry-exit statutory mandate to determine whether foreign nationals are legally in the US.",024-042,"3255 - Goal 3.1:  Strengthen and Effectively Administer the Immigration System, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3259 - Goal 2.2:  Safeguard and Expedite Lawful Trade and Travel","ADIS is an inherited system in operational steady state, and as such does not have an identified “return on investment.? However, ADIS does produce significant benefits to society that include enhanced border security and enforcement of U.S. immigration laws through the implementation of the following DHS missions, goals, and objectives:

-       DHS Mission 2 – Secure and Manage Our Borders

-       DHS Mission 3 – Enforce and Administer our Immigration Laws
o   Goal 3.2 - Prevent Unlawful Immigration
§  Objective 3.2.3 – Prevent Unlawful Entry or Admission

ADIS supports these missions, goals, and objectives by serving as the Department’s primary provider of overstay status and biographic identity services. These services represent an invaluable contribution to our nation’s security. Furthermore, discussions are underway to provide ADIS data to new stakeholders within the U.S. government (and possibly beyond) that may benefit from ADIS data (and are determined to have the authority to receive it). For example, Social Security Administration may use ADIS data to help prevent fraudulent disbursement of social security retirement or survivor benefits.","ADIS supports DHS in meet the below legislative mandates by demonstrating the capabilities requested by enabling the release of the Entry/Exit Overstay Report for FY15 (https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/01/19/dhs-releases-entryexit-overstay-report-fiscal-year-2015).

Customer Satisfaction:  Measured by the system’s ability to meet performance standards monitored via monthly evaluation of performance metrics. ADIS continues to adhere to performance targets by meeting or surpassing performance metrics during increasing customer requirements & transaction volume. 

Strategic & Business:  ADIS is the primary information system in Federal Government that can provide overstay status. Through ADIS, a master list of overstays is identified for DHS both for end-of-year DHS statistics & for weekly ICE priorities targeting a subset of the overstay population. ADIS continues to align with the appropriate missions & objectives from the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report. 

Financial Performance:  Continues to align with the OMB model. ADIS transferred to OBIM/NPPD and subsequently to CBP as a steady-state investment & did not require a formal CBA. Nevertheless, ADIS is financially justified in terms of the benefits to society & national security provided by the investment in supporting the DHS border security & enforcement of U.S. immigration laws missions & goals set forth in the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report. CBP OIT plans to evaluate overall status of ADIS within CBP beyond its existing IT configuration based on successful completion of TECS & other IT modernization efforts anticipated around FY 2020. 

Innovation:  Projected accomplishments representing technological innovation include:  1)  ADIS Reporting Environment (ADIS-R),  2)  Person ID (PID) Cleaning Analysis & Implementation, 3)  ADIS Web GUI, 4)  ADIS-R; Open Arrival Update, and 5)  ADIS Wrap-Back Services Update.

Operational Performance:  All performance targets can be significantly impacted because of failures in system availability. If ADIS is unavailable due to technical reasons, maintenance issues, or natural disasters, all of the remaining performance metrics will decline. Percentage of exit records matched to entry records is most vulnerable; performance of that specific metric is directly dependent on system availability.

Before TRIRIGA, OFAM used multiple localized tools, which led to disparate data sets.  Furthermore, these tools did not offer the Geographic Information System (GIS), environmental planning/compliance, energy management, dashboard reporting or earned value management capabilities essential to the effective management of a complex real property portfolio.  CBP is responsible for over 5,000 facilities and 4,979 acres of land in the U.S. and internationally, including CBP owned and leased, General Services Administration (GSA) owned and leased, and free space agreements. This diverse real property portfolio includes ports of entry (POE), Border Patrol stations, aircraft hangers, and border security fences.  The TRIRIGA system provides an enterprise-level solution with real property portfolio, facilities maintenance, and project management, ad hoc reporting capability, and the ability to interface with Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) programs and GIS.  TRIRIGA also provides the capability for invoice reporting, cultural resources management, self-service, and annual budget formulation.

TRIRIGA supports QHSR Goal 2.1–Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches by providing support for the management and maintenance of CBP's vast portfolio of facilities, providing one location for everything for FM&E to successfully manage facilities-related projects, maintenance, and repairs.  OFAM supports real property, engineering, acquisition, and energy and environmental management at more than 5,000 operational and administrative CBP facilities nationwide. The benefits of TRIRIGA are it helps OFAM foster the facilitation of legitimate trade and travel through the official POEs; secure our Nation’s borders between the POEs via land, air, and maritime patrols, and; house and support frontline and administrative personnel in the fulfillment of CBP’s mission. Key customers are the major CBP enforcement components (Office of Border Patrol, Office of Air and Marine, and Office of Field Operations). Stakeholders include a user community of over 1,000 users. Beneficiaries are foremost the law enforcement community and American citizens, in the form of safe and modern land ports of entry and facilities.",024-042,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","TRIRIGA’s return on investment occurred with the initial implementation of the system by eliminating multiple, disparate tools and increasing the efficiency of real property management processes.  Before TRIRIGA was implemented, CBP Office of Facilities and Asset Management (OFAM) did not possess a tool to accurately record all of CBP’s facilities, to include the capabilities of conducting assessments.  There were multiple, disparate systems collecting data on facilities, assessments, and projects.  TRIRIGA addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  Continuous improvements to the federal reporting capabilities of TRIRIGA enable OFAM to more effectively and efficiently provide facilities portfolio information to DHS.  
 
Since its transition to O&M in 2012, TRIRIGA has benefited OFAM by providing the source data for CBP reporting to the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) and DHS’s Real Property Data Warehouse (DHS-RPDW), providing the critical facilities data for CBP’s geospatial information systems and improved processes for managing operation and maintenance.  In addition, TRIRIGA provides OFAM the capability to properly budget for repair and maintenance for facilities, thereby enabling the proper allocation of funding.  Before TRIRIGA, critical facilities information was stored in SAP (which didn’t provide robust capabilities) and myriad Excel spreadsheets and Access databases.  By implementing TRIRIGA, OFAM is now able, for the first time, to collect and store all FCA data for all CBP-owned facilities in a centralized system.  TRIRIGA also calculates the facilities condition index (FCI), which provides a snapshot of CBP facilities’ health, thereby allowing leadership to plan maintenance and repairs of facilities.  As the agency moves towards maintenance of the existing portfolio, and less new construction, the FCI will be critical in determining required funding, as wellas prioritizing need.
 
Although there are limited data points, TRIRIGA is generally well-received by the user community, as is demonstrated by the results of three annual user satisfaction surveys.  Overall satisfaction has increased every year, with the past survey resulting in 76% (3.79/5.00) overall satisfaction.  While the increase is not significant it is fairly representative of the growth of a newly implemented system.  We anticipate an even higher score in the next survey.","TRIRIGA directly supports CBP and DHS in managing and auditing CBP real property, and in meeting the Federal Real Property Portfolio (FRPP) reporting requirements set by the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC). The FRPC and OMB require all federal agencies to maintain and annually report on their real property profile. The FRPC was created according to provisions in Executive Order 13327, ""Federal Real Property Asset Management,"" signed by President George W. Bush on February 4, 2004. Executive Order 13327 states: “The policy of the United States is to promote efficient and economical use of America's real property assets and to assure management accountability for implementing federal real property management reforms.""

The TRIRIGA investment is providing relatively satisfactory Customer Results.  The system provides a single source for facilities-related data for the entire Customs and Border Protection (CBP) real property portfolio.  TRIRIGA has been operational since May 2012 customer satisfaction continues to be borderline as user become accustomed to it.  There was not a single system for the real property portfolio before this system so it is taking time for Facilities Management and Engineering (FM&E) users to make the complete transition to TRIRIGA for all facilities-related transactions.  Through innovated system improvements, user education, and senior leader support, customer satisfaction is expected to continue to increase.  The program continues to meet operational performance measures.
 
STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RESULTS
The TRIRIGA program is meeting strategic and business results, and has proven to be consistently reliable in terms of system availability and synchronized responses, routinely satisfying them on a daily and monthly basis. 

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The program meets Financial Performance goals by performing at or under budget during the entire fiscal year.  Currently the program is operating under budget, based on savings from the DHS data center. 

INNOVATION
TRIRIGA is a modern IT system, but continues to be improved to support the business operations of FM&E.  Some improvements included the updated Federal Real Property Portfolio (FRPP) reporting requirements, updating of the annual budget formulation process, and incorporating CBP invoice reporting capabilities.

CBP Mobile goals are to procure and deploy mobile technology to frontline personnel in support of the QHSR strategic priority to secure U.S. air, land and sea borders and approaches and prevent terrorist attacks.  
Benefits include:  

Vehicle - mobile devices have led directly to over 1000 successful CBP enforcement actions by OFO and OBP, including identification of subjects of NCIC warrants, and the interdiction of undocumented aliens, narcotics interdiction, unreported currency and weapons violations.  
 
Rail - mobile devices are used to provide rail clearance services to the largest privately-owned passenger rail service in North America. Mobile devices provide an innovative and transformative solution for processing the train and its passengers where a CBP inspection facility does not exist.  This customer-service focused approach increased the US economic benefit while maintaining national security and set a new model for providing excellent customer service while maintaining security in a commercial environment.  
 
Maritime - mobile devices addressed a GAO recommendation to electronically verify crew members and passengers on cargo and cruise ships.  Mobile devices are used to conduct cargo and cruise ship admissibility inspections (identity and immigration status) on board vessels. 
 
Cargo - Agriculture Specialists with mobile inspection processing capability have immediate access to the applications, databases and reference material which enable real-time query, processing and verification capability.  
Outbound land - mobile devices provide valuable intelligence, enhance partnerships and assist with firearms and currency outbound interdiction operations. 
 
The CBP Mobile mission outcome is meeting the need to add mobile capability through technology which enables officers, agents and specialists to perform inspections of travelers and cargo, and identify and process undocumented aliens to improve security and enhance intelligence gathering in all locations.

An economic analysis was performed to determine program impact. Agriculture Programs and Trade Liaison (APTL), was the focus of the economic analysis.  Over 2400 tablets were deployed to Agriculture Specialists nationwide.  In a fast paced, interconnected global economy, uniform and predictable decision-making is critical to creating the business certainty necessary to support America's economic competiveness.  This requires reducing barriers to the efficient flow of trade and travel, streamlining and unifying processes and procedures, and managing the volume of cargo and passengers by separating goods and travelers according to the risks they pose.  The economic analysis yielded that the time between the completion of the physical inspection and the release of the cargo at the POE directly impacts trade goods speed to market.  The mobile device deployment decreased the release time by 98% when compared to a systems release.  Observations, POE interviews, and trade interviews yielded that a tablet release takes 1-3 minutes in real time.  POE interviews indicated that a systems release averages 2-4 hours.  Elimination of lag time between inspection end and cargo release translates to less dwell time for cargo in the POE. Analysis showed that the trade community has access to their cargo 5-24 hours faster when the tablet is used to release cargo.  This reduction of dwell time translates to the closing of critical performance gaps.  CBP experienced increased efficiency ultimately reducing manpower resource costs.  APTL Port Everglades was the economic analysis site. This deployment’s informal return on investment (ROI) calculation was based on potential reductions in release time and their impact on the trades additional landed costs in a given fiscal year. According to trade community interviews, the use of the tablet for the 21,000 tailgate inspections in 2015 resulted in an approximately $20M savings in additional landed costs (reduction of overtime for equipment and local warehouse personnel, late gate fees, truck related costs, and other non-CBP costs that commonly occur in 20% of agriculture shipments.) When compared to the initial investment of $226k, CBP Mobile has delivered a significant ROI at just a single port. CBP Mobile has: Improved cargo and passenger processing; greatly improved sea passenger/crew admissibility processing; all without compromising security, officer or traveler safety.","There was no legislative mandate of GAO audit to initiate the establishment of CBP Mobile.  In June 2011, the CBP Mobile Program Strategic Vision document was drafted to define the scope of the mobile effort by defining, at the summary level, the CBP strategic vision of how mobile technology would be used and how the program would be implemented.  CBP senior leadership established the CBP Mobile Program to provide enterprise wide solutions designed to enhance the mission by enabling operational components to meet the need to add mobility to mission critical operations. The November 15, 2012 Program Announcement memorandum named the Land Border Integration Program Management Office (LBI PMO as the CBP Mobile Program business lead.  CBP Mobile is an overarching entity for CBP-wide mobile device requests.  CBP Mobile aligns directly with two DHS missions and goals as specified in the DHS Strategic Plan; two strategic goals in the CBP Strategic Plan; the Commissioner’s Statement of CBP’s Missions, Goals and Priorities. CBP Mobile accomplishes goals and objectives detailed in the DHS Strategic Plan:  Goal 1: Secure the Nation’s borders to protect America from the entry of dangerous people and goods and prevent unlawful trade and travel.  Objective 1.3:  Identification of subjects wherever encountered will improve CBP’s ability to identify persons of interest and enhance intelligence gathering capabilities. Goal 2:  Ensure the efficient flow of legitimate trade and travel across U.S. borders. Expedite legitimate trade and travel.

AMOSS directly support security efforts beyond the physical borders of the United States and is currently utilized by the Government of Mexico (Federal Police, SEDENA/SIVA and SEMAR) to create a joint, interagency common operating picture (COP), which assists the United States and Government of Mexico conduct aviation security operations by enabling the viewing of primary suspect air tracks along Mexico’s northern border through shared US southwest border radars and flight plans approved by the FAA along the contiguous U.S./Mexico border.",024-041,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3243 - M&S Goal 6.3:  Strengthen the DHS International Affairs Enterprise In Support of Homeland Security Missions, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3260 - Goal 2.3:  Disrupt and Dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations and Other Illicit Actors, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks, 30982 - Goal 3.2: Prevent Unlawful Immigration, 46751 - Enhance Disaster Preparedness and Response","No formal Return on Investment calculation was completed prior to IOC/FOC in 1988.  There have been many benefits accrued, however, since its implementation. The early years the system was in pure O&M mainly due to the fact that the software was proprietary. In 1994, we let a new contract for a spiral development to develop a 2nd generation system which was wholly government owned and has remained that way since. That upgrade which went operational December 1998 increased the AMOSS capability to ingest additional radar/sensors and tracking capability from the 1988 original capability of 40 radars and 3,000 tracks to 128 radars and 12,000 tracks and provided an entire new user interface. We then had another major jump in capability when we did a hardware refresh in 2004 to 450 radar and 24,000 tracks and then again in 2011 to we moved away from SGI (Silicon Graphics) Hardware to Dell PCs and Servers which upgraded AMOSS to 700 sensors and 50,000 tracks and a major cost savings in hardware. AMOSS can now ingest 700 sensors and 50,000 tracks. Each sensor and track upgrade gave AMOSS the ability to have greater detection coverage. The original 40 radars and 3000 tracks only gave us coverage of the southwestern United States and we now have a good portion of the western hemisphere. This is critical to not only give more stand-off identification of targets approaching the U.S. but also allows us to better track the transnational threat. Also since 2000, we do two software upgrades a year. These software upgrades can be technical upgrades to make the systems more efficient and upgrade such things such as the surveillance tracker algorithms to better detect low, slow targets, such as ultra-lights or maritime targets, it may be to better display processor outputs and network connections to the system administers so they can better monitor the AMOSS SOC/NOC or bandwidth management. The updates also provide such items as enhanced flight plan correlations in Canada to allow forgreater stand-off and identification of aircraft arriving into the U.S., added force-tell of tracks and markers to other systems, i.e. AFNORTH Mex AMOSS and Federal Police AMOSS. We also added the capability to ingest and process military Link 11/16 data and various maritime sensors and data types. We have moved away from Oracle Forms to GTK Forms which gives us more flexibility.","The following legislation includes specific requirements addressed by the AMOC and AMOSS Investment: National Strategy for Aviation Security (NSPD-47/HSPD-16) https://www.dhs.gov/hspd-16-aviation-security-policy : Acting through Customs and Border Protection (CBP), conducting aviation law enforcement operations, including detecting, identifying, and interdicting potential air threats to national security.

BSDP is a mission critical tool that CBP has relied on to sustain officer and agent safety, and integrity, while also ensuring border security within and around all LPOEs. 
     
The goal for BSDP is to achieve more efficient and effective use of CBP resources and personnel, improved operational control and situation awareness, increased contraband seizures, enhanced CBP personnel safety and security and reinforced CBP personnel integrity.

As per the August 2016 Operational Analysis, BSDP quantitative benefits include the cost avoidance for officers, agents or guards not needed to provide persistent surveillance at and around LPOEs on a 24/7/365 basis. The cost avoidance was estimated at $94M/year. Qualitative benefits derived from the surveillance capability provided by BSDP  include: increased CBP personnel safety at LPOEs, improved emergency response times at LPOEs, reinforced CBP personnel integrity, reduced risk of CBP exposure to unsubstantiated claims at LPOEs, reduced burden on the public due to more efficient processing at LPOEs, increased efficiency and effective use of CBP resources and personnel at LPOEs, increased contraband seizures at all LPOEs, increased border security and control, improved flow of legitimate trade/travel at all LPOEs, enhanced situational awareness at LPOEs, improved officer safety in and around LPOEs, enhances visibility into the security and operational integrity at LPOEs, remote monitoring capabilities for automated border crossings, surveillance recordings used for evidence to support prosecution of criminal activity and officer integrity investigations.

During the development of the 2014 Operational Analysis (OA), the BSDP CBA was updated and compared against the financial projection estimated in the 2004 CBA. In the original CBA, BSDP was expected to provide a ROI of 589% by the year 2011. Two updated Return on Investment (ROI) scenarios were developed for the 2014 OA and in both cases the original external benefits were excluded from the calculation leaving only internal the cost avoidance benefit (reduced need for additional officers or overtime pay). The external benefit from 2004 was based on the benefit of preventing a terrorist attack on the order of 9/11 which is extremely sensitive to the probability of occurrence. In the first case described in the OA (Case 1), the benefit calculation was applied against the projected deployment scale used in the 2004 analysis. The second case (Case 2) measures the ROI against the actual deployment that occurred providing a more realistic assessment of the benefits derived and ROI achieved. (actual LPOEs and other locations utilizing BSDP). In both of the 2014 OA scenarios, the same actual costs were applied to the calculation. The result of the ROI update using actual costs showed that between 2004- 2011 BSDP ROI resulted in 479% for Case 1 (original deployment plan), and 745% for Case 2 (today’s actual deployment). As stated these calculation are exclusive of external benefits. The 479% ROI for today internal benefits compares well with the 2004 projection of 589% which also included external benefits.

The ROI calculations do not include the quantification of non-quantitative benefits for BSDP. The surveillance capability provided by BSDP delivers benefits such as:  increased personnel safety, improved emergency response, reduced risk against unsubstantiated false claims against officers, situational awareness across the enterprise, faster processing at LPOEs, better productivity of CBP officers,  increased contraband seizures, and improved border security posture. All of the described benefits are just as important in the current environment as  they were when the Program was initiated and even more so.

The goal is to introduce efficiencies in mission delivery and agency support functions by modernizing and automating revenue processes, resulting in a significant savings in time spent on revenue collection activities by CBP Officers (CBPOs) and support staff. Rev Mod estimates that full implementation will result in a decrease of up to 75% of the time spent by CBP’s uniformed personnel, and 80% by non-uniformed personnel, in revenue collection activities.  In addition to decreasing the resource time spent on revenue collections CBP plans to consolidate, automate, and streamline documentation and procedures, improve payment options and reporting capabilities, streamline facility inefficiencies and improve the legal framework with the modernized revenue processes. 
Of the approximately $45B (21 million transactions) CBP collections in duties, taxes, and fees annually, nearly $1.5B and 4 million individual transactions are processed in the field by CBPOs and support staff. Rev Mod is targeted to allow nearly 180 CBP Officers and 136 non-uniformed CBP personnel to refocus the time currently spent engaged in collection activities to focus on trade and travel enforcement and facilitation duties when transactions are moved to electronic platforms.

However, the overall objective of the Revenue Modernization Initiative is to create a long-term solution to collect and manage revenue more efficiently while enabling CBP Officers to focus their efforts on enforcement responsibilities. Rev Mod plans to have the business solution framework and associated ROI and AoA’s completed by September 2017.  The goal is to modernize the revenue processes, resulting in a significant savings in time spent performing revenue collection activities. The Rev Mod program estimates that full implementation will result in a decrease of up to 75% of the time spent by CBP’s uniformed personnel, and 80% by non-uniformed personnel, in revenue collection activities.  In addition to decreasing the resource time spent on revenue collections CBP plans to consolidate, automate, and streamline fragmented and manual revenue collections processes, documentation and procedures, improve payment options and reporting capabilities, streamline facility inefficiencies and improve the legacy legal framework with the modernized revenue processes. To achieve the overarching Rev Mod objective, given the constraints and opportunities of the current technological and operational landscape, this initiative seeks to address all identified capability gaps in a manner that aligns with DHS and CBP strategic goals and objectives. More specifically, the Revenue Modernization Initiative intends to fill capability gaps by achieving the following goals:
1. Improve payment flexibility and billing options;
2. Streamline, standardize, and otherwise improve revenue-specific business processes to achieve
efficiencies and minimize the time spent by uniformed employees on revenue-related duties;
3. Centralize and automate revenue systems to improve interoperability between POEs and streamline
financial operations;
4. Improve data quality, enhance CBP’s financial reporting capability, and increase the level of
transparency with Treasury, the travel and trade communities, and other external stakeholders; and

EVUS’ specific contribution to mission delivery, is articulated in QHSR Mission 1: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security . Outdated data may inhibit CBP from identifying aliens who represent risks to our national security, including terrorists.  EVUS will ensure that vetting processes utilize the most complete data available. Further, EVUS capabilities will allow OFO to advance the department and agency goals articulated in the CBP Strategic Plan, Vision and Strategy 2020, by securing U.S. borders by pushing the zone of security outward.

However, EVUS has delivered significant national security benefits since IOC was deployed.  Biographical information collected by EVUS resulted in the revocation of over 20 10-year visas. Since EVUS now requires the PRC to report lost/stolen PRC-issued passports, over 2 million have been reported, and over 200 EVUS enrollments have been denied on that basis.  Each denial/revocation represents a significant risk to national security that has been avoided by preventing these visa-holders from traveling to the U.S.

EVUS’ internal benefits includes reduced administrative and personnel costs resulting from replacing many millions of 1-year visas with 10-year visas, obviating government expense caused by multiple 1-year renewals. EVUS will also benefit the government by greatly improving the timeliness and accuracy of biographic and other information used for vetting. External benefits include benefits to covered aliens, who will benefit by avoiding significantly higher costs for each new 1-year visa. Since covered aliens must comply with EVUS in order to maintain the validity of their visas, the mandate is self-enforcing. Since EVUS will be fully funded program through collection of user fees, these benefits (more current vetting data, security beyond the border, reduced administrative costs) will be achieved without taxpayer expense.","The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security have statutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-79/pdf/STATUTE-79-Pg911.pdf] related to visa issuance, revocation and conditions of admission and entry for aliens seeking to enter the United States, and have mandated that CBP develop and deploy an electronic system as described in Sections 2.a. – 2.e above .

It is the authoritative source for all USCG HR and personnel management data. It is a cost efficient and effective investment that meets business owner expectations and is in alignment with USCG/DHS and USPHS/HHS missions and visions. Direct Access provides HR and payroll services to two non-DoD uniformed services - NOAA CC and USPHS CC.  All three services follow HR and payroll requirements as mandated by the annual National Defense Authorization Act and Direct Access fulfills the requirements for the 3 services. The goals of the system are to maintain state of the art HR and Payroll applications that are reliable, sustainable and secure; meet the business & mission requirements; sustain HR and payroll functions; and provide cost-effective, dependable, and accurate HR and payroll data used by CG and PHS for mission execution planning. Benefits include the consolidation of over 5 CG HR and payroll applications and 6 PHS HR applications, including the legacy Joint Uniform Military Payroll System (JUMPS). USPHS has gained new functions that help manage their workforce, and improve accountability and efficiency in support of their missions. On 4/1/2008, the USCG Retiree and Annuitant payroll processing system was formally migrated from a legacy, custom-built, mainframe based system into the Direct Access application. In 4QFY07, USPHS CC was directed by OMB to investigate the CG’s success in implementing a commercial HR and Payroll product. This demonstrates that the USCG is a Center of Excellence as a provider of outsourced Military HR services. Direct Access has achieved significant cost savings through system and application migrations in compliance with: FITARA, FMIA and FMFIA, & the guidance to maximize the use of COTS and Agile development. This investment is required to meet personnel tracking and military payroll requirements documented in Titles 10 & 14 of the U.S. Code.  It enables real-time data for ready deployment of USCG and USPHS personnel in response to planned and unplanned mission events. Direct Access provides a tool that captures officer skillsets and position requirements in an integrated and standardized way, allowing hiring officials and deployment staff to match officers with the attributes needed for the role at hand.

It is a cost effective Operations and Maintenance (O&M) IT investment that exceeds business owner expectations. As evidenced by the data below, the Direct Access investment continues to prove to be extremely beneficial for stakeholders both internal and external to USCG. The migration of each of the systems into Direct Access has resulted in over $4M in annual cost savings in terms of hardware, software, and administrative support. The system pays huge dividends by integrating all aspects of HR to allow for a true Talent Management System. Through integrating PeopleSoft’s payroll system, Global Pay, lines of accounting controls have been greatly enhanced for Active Duty (AD) and Reserve personnel. It ensures improved and accurate lines of accounting in Direct Access, which has allowed USCG’s Pay and Personnel Center (PPC) to discontinue two backend manual accounting processes. 
  
External benefits have increased with this consolidation in that users can access a single payroll application in one place. Additionally, prior to Direct Access, the Service Personnel Office (SPO) had to process every individual leave transaction manually.  Through the functionality of Absence Requests, the number of requests to be manually processed by SPO was reduced by 260,000 annually. This translates into eliminating approximately 13,500 man-hours of data entry work, a total cost savings of $548,166 per year. Direct Access also resulted in the elimination of 115 Yeoman billets in 2000, a $12M annual recurring savings every year since.   Additionally, from 2004 to 2014, the implementation of Direct Access has proven a 20% increase in customer satisfaction for completing individual personnel transactions.  
   
The ROI is calculated by the savings from Yeoman billets ($12M) plus the savings from automating absence request processing ($0.548M) plus the FY13 savings from systems transitioned into Direct Access (Orders and Accessions) and decommissioning of RATS ($1.200M) divided by FY13 costs ($10.270M).","Direct Access directly aligns to legislative mandates, including Titles 10 and 14 of the U.S. Code and the Coast Guard 11 Statutory Missions (found at: http://uscode.house.gov/download/download.shtml) by closing the requirement gap in meeting USCG delivery and management of personnel tracking and military payroll requirements. 

Direct Access’ integration of five separate CG applications and six PHS applications into one allows for more cross functional use while reducing data errors by eliminating interfaces.  The consolidation of multiple systems into Direct Access allows for reduction in the costs associated with configuration management, change management, security certification and accreditation, IT governance, and Earned Value Management (EVM).   Use of a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) solution with outsourced hosting has also provided significant long-term cost savings in terms of technology refresh costs for hardware and application upgrades.

In determining the ROI, the R21 Key Decision Point (KDP) 1 was completed in Jul 1995 and authorized entry into the program’s Concept and Technology Demonstration phase under the authority of DOT. In Aug 1999, KDP2 authorized the program to proceed into the Capability Development and Demonstration phase. In Aug 2001, the Coast Guard awarded three R21 Phase I contracts to competing contractors to develop proposed system designs. The Phase I proposals were reviewed in late 2001 and the Phase II production contract RFP was issued in Feb 2002. Following a formal source selection process, the USCG’s Source Selection Official (SSO) awarded the R21 Phase II production contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems in Sep 2002. In Jul 2005, DHS authorized the R21 program to proceed into the Production and Deployment phase and full rate production subsequently commenced in Sep 2005. 
 
Internal Benefits: R21 is used to tailor CG response (including coordinating with local first responders and federal coordinators), significantly reducing response time to mariners in distress. The R21 system enhances the CG’s ability to detect & respond to distress calls in the coastal zone, which directly benefits the U.S. public’s marine safety & saves lives. Benefits also include system disaster recovery capabilities that have supported coordination in numerous federals regional response and remediation efforts by providing a critical communication backbone in the disaster regions. For example, the R21 system provided a communication system that supported efforts to re-open ports in NY and NJ after hurricane Sandy.

NAIS is a data collection, processing and distribution system that provides international Maritime Organization (IMO)-adopted Automatic Identification System (AIS) information to enhance safety of navigation and our Marine Transportation System (MTS), and improve Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The project provides the necessary capability to ensure the effective exchange of information  between AIS-equipped vessels, aircraft, ATON, and shore stations within all major U.S. ports, waterways, and coastal zones.  It integrates a network of AIS receivers and transmitters, data processing and storage centers, and user interface services that capture, exchange, and analyze data of critical interest for maritime safety and security.  Data collected supports the nation's maritime interest, from the safety of vessels and ports through collision avoidance, to the safety of the nation through detection, traffic identification, and classification of vessels.
Benefits/Stakeholders:
The data collected by NAIS will be shared with other pertinent stakeholders and decision makers in support of maritime security at critical ports.  NAIS supports a layered defense and requirements for Advanced Notice of Arrival by correlating AIS data with target vessel reporting and other maritime awareness data to focus resources on higher interest vessels.  The key customers and primary beneficiaries of NAIS include: USCG, CBP, Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, IRS, indirectly to the international community through MSSIS, and port partners.  Maritime Operational Threat Response benefits in achieving a coordinated U.S. Government response to threats to the US in the maritime domain.  NAIS will facilitate the Coast Guard response to threats in the maritime domain by enabling better visibility of suspect vessels as well as other vessels in the vicinity.  NAIS will allow for visibility and tracking of U.S. Government vessel assets for improved overall coordination of resources.  Maritime Communications benefits are associated with improved USCG ability to communicate with vessels in support of various USCG missions.  These benefits include the enhanced exchange of navigation information, improved communications interoperability with foreign vessels and other Government agencies' vessels, and backup capability to the Rescue 21 voice systems via AIS messaging.  The following USCG systems are dependent upon NAIS: IOC,  WebCOP, eGIS, MISLE, and MAGNet.",024-037,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches, 3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","NAIS improves maritime domain awareness and offers improvements in collision avoidance, maritime safety, environmental protection and national security through the detection, classification and tracking of vessels whether they are in national water or still thousands of miles off shore.  

The ROI of 7.94, as calculated in the NAIS Alternatives Analysis of Dec 29, 2006, was calculated by determining the sum of the present value of all benefits and dividing it by the sum of the present value of all costs of each capability.  The benefits of security risk reduction (such as detection of large commercial vessel introduces WMD into US port and fishing vessel has a crew member onboard suspected of being a terrorist) are included in the ROI calculation.  The benefits of operational performance (such as improved Search and Rescue detection and response and collision detection and enforcement) have not been included because the confidence in those calculations was low; however if they were to be included, the ROI would be even higher.  The benefits were calculated for the following capabilities provided by NAIS: coastal receive, coastal transmit, long range receive, advanced data capability, and inland waters receive and transmit.  For each capability a variety of scenarios were evaluated using probabilities of occurrence and consequence costs to demonstrate the improvement in security risk by implementing NAIS.  

The present value of all costs of each capability was calculated using the LCCE produced as part of the NAIS Alternatives Analysis document.  The total benefit was calculated as $5,704,345,592; the total LCC was calculated as $718,062,000; the ROI was calculated as 7.94.  

While 7.94 is the ROI for the whole NAIS system, each Increment offers improvements in each capability to differing degrees.  Increment 1 primarily benefits coastal receive.  After recapitalization of Increment 1 with Increment 2, the return on investment is significant improvement of marine safety and security by increasing receive coverage from 24nm to 50 nm, the addition of transmit capability out to 24 nm, and advanced data capability.  Increment 3 primarily benefits long range receive.","NAIS derives from the U.S. obligations under Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974,  an international treaty, calls for automatic identification system of vessels; Maritime Transportation Safety Act (MTSA) Act of 2002 which is CG efforts in improving its knowledge of the ships calling at U.S. ports as “Maritime Domain Awareness?

VLS consists of two component systems:  the Fleet Logistics System (FLS), and the Naval and Electronics Supply Support System (NESSS).  FLS provides an integrated logistics system for configuration management, financial and procurement management, maintenance information, and supply support data for over 240 cutters, 1000 standard boats, C4IT equipment, and buoys.  FLS provides NESSS with supply data using maintenance information.  FLS also enables field units to create and send Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) transactions and generate obligation accounting data.  NESSS supports all supply activities needed for the naval and electronics program and provides supply data for use by FLS.  NESSS also supports the financial management system for the CG Yard.
The purpose of VLS is to continue providing a suite of tools to the CG’s surface logistics community to perform management of configuration, maintenance, supply chain, and finance and procurement data. There are approximately 2389 VLS users. VLS has approximately 755 concurrent users during a normal business day, and approximately 14,000 logins per quarter. The CG is in the process of transforming/aligning business processes for logistics. Logistics will use a single set of business processes referred to as the Mission Support Business Model (MSBM) and the 4 cornerstones of that model: Configuration Management, Total Asset Visibility, Bi-Level Maintenance, and a single point of accountability through Product Line Managers.
Goals for VLS are primarily short term and are focused on ensuring sustainability from a technical standpoint until it is replaced by the Coast Guard Logistics Information Management System (CG-LIMS).  CG-LIMS is a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) system being configured to replace multiple legacy systems and is intendedto be a single enterprise asset management system for the CG.
Stakeholders, customers, and other beneficiaries of VLS include CG Headquarters directorates and offices, Logistics Centers, C4IT Service Center and its asset lines, Naval Engineering/Electronic Support Units, Product Line Managers, Asset Materiel Managers, Coast Guard Yard, Asset Project Offices, Finance Center, Cutters and boats, other government activities, contractors, and vendors.",024-039,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 5502 - M&S Goal 6.6: Strengthen Service Delivery and Manage DHS Resources","VLS supports business processes for the CG surface logistics community, directly supporting DHS Strategic Goals of Prevention, Protection, Response, Recovery and Service.

This project addresses item three of the five parts that constitute an IOC. For each location to achieve “IOC designation? an agreement must be in place between relevant port partners for 1. regularly scheduled coordination meetings; 2. agencies to share awareness of maritime assets’ operational schedules; 3. direct access to Watchkeeper; 4. joint awareness/coordination between CG and CBP of planned vessel inspections; and 5. unified command structure under which the IOC operates.
 
Goals:   
* Collaborate with port partners for joint planning and operations through risk-based assignment of resources to mission demands; 
* Share targeting, intelligence and scheduling information to improve situational awareness, uncover gaps in planned and ongoing operations, and reduce duplication of effort between agencies; 
* Allow Coast Guard command centers to develop real-time awareness, evaluate threats and deploy finite resources to the right places through active collection of port activity information; and
* Minimize the economic impact from any disruption, whether natural or manmade.
 
Benefits: 
* Access to a geographic information tool that provides a common operating picture to achieve enhanced situational awareness
* Shared awareness of the operational schedules of maritime assets in the port
* A tool to present and share the products of regular coordination meetings with federal, state and local port partners, including awareness and coordination between USCG and CBP of planned vessel inspection activities.
 
Mission Contribution:  A primary enabler of IOCs is the establishment of an information sharing and management system. This software, called    WatchKeeper, facilitates information exchange across multi-agency port partners, and coordinates and organizes port security information to help DHS and other federal, state and local maritime partners make the best use of their resources to keep America’s ports safe.

Each sector has, on average, 3 shifts of 3 WatchStanders. The use of the WatchKeeper system has reduced the need to log into several other systems, thus saving approximately 30 minutes of time per WatchStander per day. 

Therefore, current annual return on investment (ROI) from a purely manpower standpoint is 37 Sectors X 365 days X 3 shifts X 3 WatchStanders X ½ man hours saved per day = 60,772.50 man hours saved annually.
These man hours can be spent on other IOC activities, further reducing staffing needs at each Sector while improving the effectiveness of the WatchStander. 

The use of the WatchKeeper system benefits other organizations by proving them with an integrated view and consolidation of multiple system interfaces into one system and eliminates the need for them to build and maintain similar systems providing WatchKeeper functions. Overall, while the investment is providing value to the users, the Program Office continues to explore cost effective alternatives and opportunities for convergence. The program is exploring system enhancements based on a planned migration to an open architecture and the development of IOC business-based widgets (Ozone Widget Framework standards) that will permit improved management of services and adaptation of functionality during the operations and maintenance phase. The Ozone Widget Framework is an application based concept that is being adopted by the Federal government and WatchKeeper is the first investment in USCG to utilize this framework.","The IOC Project implements the mandates of the SAFE Port Act which introduces Interagency Operations Centers (IOC) while transforming Coast Guard Sector Command Centers (SCCs) to function in an IOC context.

PAWSS is a part of the Vessel Traffic Services program, and is one of several systems used for this program. The PAWSS was Congressionally Mandated to modernize Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) in five ports (New York (NY). Houston/Galveston (HG), San Francisco (SF), Prince William Sound (PWS), and Puget Sound (PS)) and introduce automated VTS systems in four other ports (Lower Mississippi River (LMR), Sault Ste. Marie (SSM) Berwick Bay (BB), and Port Arthur (PA)) through the use of commercially available technology including Automatic Identification System (AIS), Radars, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV), and voice communications.

Benefits
 
PAWSS is a Vessel Traffic Service navigation information system that is based on commercial off-the-shelf products consisting of sensors, communications, and decision support equipment. PAWSS automates several processes for the Vessel Traffic Services Program and allows watchstanders to focus more on evaluating the traffic picture. PAWSS is deployed in a number of coastal locations throughout the U.S. and allows the Coast Guard to propagate important navigation information to mariners, thereby reducing collisions, groundings, and facilitates the safe and efficient transit of vessel traffic. The system compresses radar, VHF-FM voice, AIS, and video from remote sites into commercial leased landlines or microwaves and sends the information to a central VTS (Vessel Traffic Center). The vessel data is processed and displayed in a graphical interface, chart based format that leads itself to early recognition of potentially dangerous situations. A minimum of twelve months of vessel transit data is stored in an Oracle database for later reconstructing collisions, spills or other incidences. Additionally, the historical data facilitates data mining to analyze potential trends, such as, traffic density, port tonnage and fulfilling Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. PAWSS utilizes Commercial off the Shelf (COTS)software and hardware. The core component of the PAWSS is based upon the proprietary Lockheed Martin MTM-200 Software Architecture.

The key requirements of the AIS-based VTS reduced risk of vessel casualties, promote public safety, protect environment, facilitate commerce, reduce voice communications and cross functionality with other systems.  Additionally, operating a single Vessel Traffic Management Information System (VTMIS) will significantly reduce the operating and maintenance costs.  In addition, the cost of training watchstanding personnel on a single system will introduce a considerable savings not only in expenses but in man-hours as well.  Operating a single VTMIS introduces a common thread for VTS personnel at a VTS to interact with personnel at other VTSs to initiate lessons learned, discuss workarounds and share training successes.  A single VTMIS will afford areas of the country with multiple VTSs, the ability to share common data with private industry partners located in neighboring ports.","The Coast Guard has a statutory responsibility under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA) of 1972, Title 33 U.S. Code (U.S.C) Section 1221, to ensure the safety and environmental protection of U.S. ports and waterways.

ISCD replaced the legacy CHEMS software with a best-of-breed BPM tool; this tool improves the CSAT Suite’s ability to quickly implement business process changes as the CFATS program continues to mature. This in part enabled CSATs to implemented new requirements of the CFATS Act of 2014 within the six-month deadline while simultaneously developing and delivering numerous minor enhancements and bug fixes to the software that improve the user experience and quality of data collected for the regulatory program. In FY16, ISCD released the Personnel Surety application which allowed users to submit employees for vetting against the terrorist screening databases with CBP and TSA.
Strategic & Business Results: The investment is critical to DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security, Goals 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, as described in the DHS Strategic Plan. The investment is critical to NPPD Goal 3: Provide improved risk management and analysis capabilities to government and private sector stakeholders, Objective 3.2 as described in the NPPD Strategic Plan for FY 2014-2018. The investment represents essential technology comprising of people, processes, and technology, and provides an indispensable capability that directly impacts DHS’s ability to meet its mission.
Financial Performance: Since program inception in FY06, ISCD has maintained the investment’s cost variance & schedule variance percentages within +/-10% of the latest rebaseline. ISCD performed an Alternatives Analysis for the legacy CHEMS application and determined that a COTS BPM tool would require less IT development effort to maintain. The BPM tool wasdeployed to production in early FY14.
Innovation: CSATS functional capabilities are designed to fulfill the unique legislative requirements of the CFATS program. ISCD has completed virtualization of the CSAT Suite and modernized the legacy CHEMS application, replacing it with a COTS BPM tool. ISCD is also migrating the CSAT Suite production environment to an IaaS host in FY17.

NCPS consists of the hardware, software, supporting processes, training, and services that are being developed and acquired to support the Department’s mission requirements as delineated in the CNCI and mandated in NSPD-54/ HSPD-23.  NCPS provides a wide range of cyber security capabilities for the Federal Executive Branch government networks (.gov domain), including:  intrusion detection (passive defense); intrusion prevention (active defense); advanced cyber analytics – such as data aggregation & correlation, visualization, malware analysis, and packet capture; incident management; and information sharing and collaboration. NCPS aligns with three missions in the 2014 DHS QHSR: 1. Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security; 4. Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace; and 5. Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience. NCPS contributes to Terrorism Prevention as cyber-terrorism becomes intertwined with cybercrime and state-sponsored activity. NCPS also supports efforts to strengthen and safeguard national infrastructure. NCPS aligns most directly with the Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace mission, and it supports all four goals of the 2014 QHSR: 4.1 Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure; 4.2 Secure the Federal Civilian Government Information Technology Enterprise; 4.3 Advance Law Enforcement, Incident Response, and Reporting Capabilities, and 4.4 Strengthen the Ecosystem.

Current/Anticipated Benefit: NCPS enables a perimeter defense for the .gov domain that augments Department and Agency internal cyber capabilities.  NCPS also increases cyber information sharing across the environment and significantly improves the overall security posture of the Departments and Agencies. This range of capabilities supports NCCIC operations and reduces the time to respond to and recover from cyber-attacks when they occur.

Users: The users of the NCPS capability within the Department are NCCIC and outside the Department are Departments and Agencies (D/A) Security Operations Centers (SOCs). 

Stakeholders of the NCPS include: Federal executive leadership, Federal Executive Branch civilian D/As, tribal, state and local government, law enforcement, private industry, and international partners.",024-014,"3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks, 5442 - Goal 4.1:  Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure against cyber attacks and other hazards","The ROI’s current calculation is -87.96 as calculated through the end of the current FY18-22 LCCE. The ROI was calculated by capturing the countermeasures (SMTP and DNS) data that is recorded on a quarterly basis by NSD with NCCIC. These countermeasures are the way that NCPS mitigates cybersecurity issues on behalf of the government civilian network. Through a combination of seat growth related to how civilian agencies are anticipated to onboard under the NCPS cybersecurity umbrella combined with an estimated growth rate for countermeasure per agency based on historical data, an estimate of total countermeasures is propagated each quarter through FY22. A cost avoidance (thus benefit) per countermeasure incident is then estimated using an internal tool that estimates the costs to mitigate cybersecurity incidents. These benefits are then measured against the LCCE for the NCPS through FY22 to provide the ROI estimate for the NCPS. This approach was considered a better option than using the Corporate Finance formula as suggested by the DHS Management Program as it provides a more updated approach for assessing benefits. In terms of assessing the negative ROI some key points must be considered with respect to the NCPS. First the program creates a new capability in providing perimeter defense for Federal Executive Departments and Agencies (D/A) in the .gov domain under the requirements of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI). This perimeter defense provides an overarching layer of cybersecurity by detecting, analyzing, and preventing cyber-attacks upon the civilian agency .gov domain. In addition, these services are provided without reimbursement from the supported D/As. Because of this, the program likely will not recover the initial DME. NCPS is a cost avoidance system that, through its functioning, prevents cybersecurity events from happening and/or reducing the negative impacts on the affected D/A. NSD continues to investigate other ways to better assess the direct benefits provided by the NCPS by defining the costs avoided by D/As for investigating and mitigating malicious cyber activities. As more D/As are added to NCPS coverage, cost avoidance calculations should show a lower negative ROI. However, it is not anticipated that the ROI will ever reach a positive value.","Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, by law, DHS now must deploy a system to (1) detect cybersecurity risks in network traffic transiting or traveling to or from an agency information system, and (2) prevent or modify such traffic to remove cybersecurity risks. This system is the NCPS, and is now a mandate by law to have all of the D/As be brought onboard by the end of 2016. https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s1869/BILLS-114s1869is.xml

Risk Analysis: Updated the project and operational risks reported for NCPS in 2016.
Per the analysis completed for the 2016 OA, NCPS is a highly complex, evolutionary system targeted at both filling gaps in the Governments' capability to defend against cybersecurity threats, and at building a strong information sharing capability between the stakeholder organizations at all levels of Government. As an evolutionary program, the development and fielding of each new block expands capabilities to meet ever-evolving cybersecurity and mission needs. NCPS systems now in O&M have proven their worth and sustainability to meet overall program objectives. The NCPS Program Office constantly assesses new means and tools to improve overall capabilities and address the needs of Government entities being protected.

This year's 2016 OA determined that greater emphasis be placed on provisioning D/As for E3A and the need to better understand how E3A is supporting the D/As. This will furthermore open up sharing capabilities with the D/As for information sharing and advanced analytics. In addition, the OA identified the need to further collaborate with the customer on the NCPS toolset with respect to how it is maintained and how new tools are introduced or modified.",3,"The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) program is in the Mixed life cycle phase.

Users continue to use the NCCIC portal hosted on HSIN as requirement discussions are underway with end users and the HSIN PMO for improvements to the portal, including a compliant instant messaging (IM) service.  An operational assessment is also planned during the next review cycle.  Attaining authorized staffing levels remains a challenge due to delays in the Component’s hiring process.  Program leadership has a plan in place to provision staff as needed. Target Departments and Agencies (D/As) onboarding activities are also impacted by the availability of agency resources, D/As priorities, and the complexity of the participating D/A’s network architecture. EINSTEIN 3 Accelerated (E3A), focus continues to be on provisioning the remaining D/As while the program conducts Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) for E3A.  The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 mandated Federal Agencies to adopt all existing EINSTEIN capabilities by December 2016. The program’s Service Integration team is prioritizing both current and future resources to support onboarding efforts.  As of December 2016, all Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies have deployed at least one of the E3A intrusion prevention countermeasures (DNS Sinkholing and/or Email filtering). Currently 228 federal agencies are participating in E3A on at least one countermeasure, approximately 94% of the user population.

This initiative directly responds to four key pieces of policy guidance for DHS and its role in federal network security. It supports DHS Mission Four, “Safeguarding and Securing Cyberspace.? It is in direct support of the Administration’s 2016 Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal for implementing continuous monitoring across the federal network space. It supports OMB-14-03 which mandates agencies to use the CDM/CMaaS BPA as contract terms expire for information security continuous monitoring systems, and suggests that agencies leverage the DHS CDM program.  And finally, CDM supports OMB-16-04, Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP) for the Federal Civilian Government.

DHS will be better prepared to fulfill these goals with the implementation of the federal-level dashboard. The dashboard will include summary data to allow DHS to assess the level of risk by agency. 

This program addresses the following mission operations capabilities: 

Improve the security posture of federal .gov networks; improve the effectiveness and efficiency by which federal networks are secured; build maturity into the continuous monitoring/diagnostics program across the federal enterprise; develop a federal network infrastructure that is solidly based on secure engineering principles; transfer risk to where it appropriately belongs and establish and maintain accountability; and fix the worst items first, allowing real-time prioritization of remediation activities.",024-014,"5442 - Goal 4.1:  Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure against cyber attacks and other hazards","The program completed both an alternatives analysis and solution engineering analysis. The ROI reflected in the AA section of the Business Case is reflective of the Solution Engineering Analysis. Within the AA, there was an assumption that since mitigation was not included within the investment, there could be no claim of removal of threat. However, the solution engineering analysis determined that the best approach would be an ROI calculated based on the potential mitigation of known threats and vulnerabilities. The ROI is based solely upon benefits/investment of Increment 1 since Increments 2 and 3 are not currently defined well enough to determine benefits. ROI is calculated as Rate of Return = (Gain of Investment/ Cost of Investment) - 1.
 
Three sources were used to calculate the benefits of mitigation activities. Method 1 - Cost Per Attack; Method 2 - Ponemon Institute/HP Study 2011; Method 3 - Banking Article. These three sources are all comparable, calculating the same benefits. The three sources were averaged because it is unknown which source would represent a more realistic scenario to the federal government. The true benefits could lie anywhere within the range shown in these calculations.
 
As stated above, these three methods were averaged. The average benefit would be approximately $0.9B in BY13$. Then, to calculate the ROI, to the $0.9B, the difference in O&M costs from the baseline were added, and then that result was divided by the Investment + PMO costs for Increment 1 would be the following:
 
ROI 1: (($419.85+-308.03)/391.208)-1= 71.42%
ROI 2: ((2012.83+-308.03)/391.208)-1 = 335.78%
ROI 3: ((369.29+-308.03)/391.208)-1 = -84.34
 
The average benefit is ((419.85+2012.83+369.29)+-308.03)/391.208 – 1 = 60.01%.","CDM meets requirements in the following ways: Legislative Mandate: Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013: https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/240.

The Infrastructure Protection Gateway (IP Gateway) investment supports the Office of Infrastructure Protection in meeting its mission of assessing key assets and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and taking action to mitigate vulnerabilities, enhance security, and ensure continuity and necessary redundancy.  This includes establishing and maintaining a national database of each system or asset that the Secretary determines to be vital and the loss, interruption, incapacity, or destruction of which would have a negative or debilitating effect on the economic security, public health, or safety of the United States, any State, or any local government.
IP Gateway delivers a suite of specialized tools to DHS Components, Federal agencies, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) governments, and owner/operators of our nation’s critical infrastructure through a modularized system.  These tools aid the collection and protection of our nation’s critical infrastructure information.  A consistent methodology applied to assessments supports robust analytics, asset-to-asset comparisons, and cross-government sharing of critical infrastructure information.  Textual and geospatial interfaces assist users in understanding the underlying data and improve the ability to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities.  Tools reinforce efforts in threat contingency planning and incident tracking.  The IP Gateway provides data on events such as flooding and power outages in semi-real-time.
The system ties together different aspects of protecting infrastructure into one convenient location; this improves productivity and makes our nation safer.  Life cycle cost reduction continues as IP Gateway consolidates and modularizes existing capabilities into a smaller, more efficient server-side footprint, removing redundancy in IT applications.  The specialized capabilities of IP Gateway are available through a secure, encrypted, controlled-access web interface.",024-013,"5442 - Goal 4.1:  Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure against cyber attacks and other hazards","Through the facilitation of information sharing in the domain of critical infrastructure (CI), the IP Gateway continues to provide a single source for the Federal government and the CI community. Additionally, it provides capabilities to State, local, tribal and territorial critical infrastructure protection partners (i.e., first responders, homeland security advisors, law enforcement, etc.) that State and local governments would not be capable of providing. The IP Gateway continues to be an economical way of providing secure hosting for multiple applications across multiple Federal entities, such as the Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP), Federal Protective Service (FPS), and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C). The benefits to the government include cost savings in operations and maintenance (O&M), the centralized servicing of the IP Gateway capabilities, and the economies of scale associated with the wholesale procurement of hardware and software. The benefit analysis shows an annual return on investment of 26%, with the breakeven point anticipated to occur in 2016. 
The IP Gateway has provided added benefits through the following capabilities that support incident management and steady state risk analysis for critical infrastructure (CI): 
-Making Critical Infrastructure data searchable, accessible and retrievable while still secure 
-Data and report storage capability 
-CI, cyber, and Federal facility risk assessment and analysis capabilities 
-Asset management functionality 
-Steady state and incident management tracking capabilities 
-Data mining and visualization functionality  
-Capability which enables field assessment activity scheduling and reporting  
-Report generating capability for CI assets, cyber information, and federal facility information 
-Capable of depicting CI facilities geographically and filtering by Sectors and Sub-sectors 
-Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) management capability 
-CI dependency and interdependency analysis capability.","1.

* Strategic and Business Results: Partnerships with NPPD/Federal Protective Services (FPS), NPPD/Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis (OCIA), and NPPD/Office of Cyber security and Communications (CS&C) has allowed the Department to better meet legislative and departmental goals while addressing the business need for reducing costs across NPPD.    

* Financial Performance: The IP Gateway cost variance as shown in the Investment Management System is currently at 9.77 percent. The projects managed under the IP Gateway are operations and management contracts, not actually projects. Since contracts do not burn at a consistent rate for operations and maintenance, there will usually be a variance due to this breakdown. 

* Innovation: IP plans to award a contract in FY 2017 for an analysis of alternatives on hosting (cloud/data center) environments. This aligns with the DHS push to consolidate hosting to a Data Center or Cloud Environment. IP and NPPD are discussing the possibility of decommissioning the IP Gateway Program and standing up a new program as part of the migration.
 
* Operational Performance Measures: The investment exceeded its operational metrics during the reporting period of June 2015 to May 2016. To exceed a target means that the metric was above or below the target in a positive direction. For example, if the target is four seconds or less and the monthly metric was three seconds, the monthly metric was below target and, therefore, exceeded the target for the month.

* Risk Analysis:  If the Infrastructure Information Collection Division does not submit the Statement of Work and the IGCE into the Information Technology Acquisition Review and procurement on time, then operations and maintenance on the IP Gateway may stop. If the Infrastructure Protection Information Technology Governance Board does not work efficiently then there will be a delay in the program's ability to update the Information Protection Gateway which could impact funding.

Specifically, the goals of LSCMS include the ability to:

 - Manage the entire supply chain, including FEMA-owned assets and resources as well as those provided by partners in other federal agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
 - Ensure the right resources/commodities are available at the right place and time 
 - Divert resources/commodities based on changing demand
 - Know the location and status of capital assets, commodities, and all other resources in real time
 - See inventory at all distribution nodes (e.g. Distribution Centers (DCs), Incident Support Bases (ISBs), Mobile Housing Unit (MHU) sites, and material delivered to state staging areas and local Points of Distribution (PODs)
 - Integrate with the supply chains of partners in federal government agencies, and other Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) and non-ESF federal agencies, NGOs, and logistics service vendors
 - Share supply chain data with state/local/tribal governments

An analysis of gaps to current requirements, a limited analysis of alternatives (AoA) to address the gaps, and an operational benchmarking similar to other logistics operations is to be performed. The LSCMS Program Office worked with DHS to obtain AoA contractor expertise from MITRE - timeframe to complete the AoA Study Plan is 11/20/14 and the Limited AoA by 11/30/15.
 
Annual LSCMS acquisition costs vary, O&M costs change as development components are implemented and public benefits, disaster frequency and severity are unpredictable. The ROI formula has too many unpredictable components to be calculated precisely, but an ROI qualitative analysis is useful:
ROI=(((Original Baseline O&M - New Total O&M) + Other Benefits to Society)/Acquisition Cost Only)-1
   
The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2028 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)
   
Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in “benefits to society.?
· Previous O&M = averaged $29.85M
· New O&M = $24.88M
With increasing resource costs, O&M costs are not anticipated to decrease.
· System cost Benefits = $5M
· Public Benefits > $20M
  
ROI = (((29.854M-24.883M)+385.550M)/102.017)-1 = 283%
System cost benefits include: Savings from developmental alternatives, resource optimization and hardware and asset inventory; cost avoidances from reduction in legacy O&M costs, better asset management and COOP; and productivity improvements from data visibility, automation, and partner integration.","The Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA) directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop an efficient, transparent, and flexible logistics system for procurement and delivery of materials and services necessary for an effective and timely response and recovery, and for real-time visibility of items at each point throughout the logistics system (Public Law 109-295-Oct 4, 2006; Sec. 636, Logistics).

An ROI of .221 indicates that the Program increases benefits to society such that the initial investment is recovered, and a return (savings in excess of original investment) is incurred.  
The IPAWS investment improves the effectiveness and efficiency by which public safety officials can provide warning messages to all people in a danger area – increasing the likelihood that people receive timely warning information and the likelihood that people will take action to avoid or mitigate the impact of disaster incidents.  Avoidance and mitigation of disaster impacts benefits society by enabling people to take protective measures saving lives and reducing the cost of response and recovery activities after a disaster – representing future savings for federal, state, local, private sector, and private citizens.
The integrated interoperable systems and open standards interfaces of IPAWS create a simple gateway between public safety officials and multiple communications systems supporting access for public alert and warning message delivery.  The small IPAWS investment in infrastructure, agreements, and partnerships enables authorized agencies, including more than 20,000 non-federal public safety officials, to utilize multiple private sector infrastructure investments to communicate emergency warning information to people.
Access via IPAWS is free for authorized public safety agencies, representing cost savings for using agencies versus developing, deploying and sustaining independent systems for local alert and warning capabilities.

2) The Bureau and Statistical Agent, which supports the iService system and the business services of the NFIP, by providing financial and statistical control, training materials for over 80 participating insurance companies, and multiple other business functions for the NFIP.
3) The NFIP Virtual Information Technology System (NVITS), which is the environment that hosts the FloodSmart and Underwriting & Claims Operation Review Tool (UCORT).
 
Without the capability embodied by the IT S&S investment, the NFIP would be unable to process flood insurance policies and claims for more than 5.3 million flood policies.   
 
As NFIP’s System of Record, IT S&S investment is critical to mission attainment, helping facilitate flood insurance transactions like policy issuance and claims payments to flood survivors.   IT S&S supports the following DHS and FEMA missions: DHS Mission 5 (Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience), FEMA Strategic Priority 4 (Enable Disaster Risk Reduction Nationally), and Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA) Goal 2, Obj. 2.1 (Enhance Credibility/Effective Program Delivery). The key benefit of this investment is the continued operation of the NFIP and implementation of critical legislative reforms resulting from Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 and the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.  
 
Key investment stakeholders include: policyholders, FEMA components, FIMA, the Direct Servicing Agent, WYO Insurance companies, insurance vendors, adjusters, insurance agents, communities, and others.In order to leverage technology advances, FEMA is in the process of migrating these systems from Contractor Owned Contractor Operated facilities to Government Owned Government Operated facilities.

Given this length of time, it is likely that this system has provided a very favorable return on its original investment.  Additionally, this system allows the NFIP to sell flood insurance and pay claims to U.S. persons in a time of flooding disaster. 
 
As described in responses to questions 9a and 9b, the continued operation of the Legacy Support System (the IT system within the IT S&S investment) is critical to the day-to-day operation of the NFIP, just as the support functions provided by the continued work funded under the BSA contract is critical to NFIP’s ability to update program documentation; respond to flooding disasters by opening Flood Response Offices (FRO), and providing training to key stakeholders, including claims adjusters.","See the table below for the list and URL's describing the legislative mandate, published agency strategic plan and Presidential Direction that apply to the Phoenix Program.",yes,yes,www.floodsmart.gov|www.agents.floodsmart.gov|https://nfi-ucort.csc.com/login.aspx|www.nfipiservice.com|bsa.nfipstat.fema.gov|intranetserver/bureaunet|lookup.nfipstat.fema.gov/ibi_html/public/wfsignon.htm|intranetserver/ibi_html/public/lookup.htm,"Freddy Valdivia","1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior",221.325,47.055,46.292,46.292,1983,2022,"FEMA - NFIP IT Systems and Services no longer includes planning activities for the replacement investment, FEMA - NFIP IT Phoenix.
