HSIN is the only federal portal that provides information sharing among DHS and its partners across the full spectrum of homeland security missions. HSINs key customers and stakeholder are comprised of Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector and international officials engaged in emergency management, immigration control, fire services, emergency medical services, law enforcement and a number of other specific homeland security missions. The HSIN system groups key customers and stakeholders into Communities of Interest (COIs) so that coordination and collaboration can occur within specific mission areas. HSIN benefits its customer base through the provision of (1) a nationwide information exchange platform, (2) in a secure environment (3) where only trusted partners have access to separate knowledge space, (4) where document uploading and storage is enabled, (5) where real-time screen sharing collaboration is available, (6) with secure email messaging capability and secure chat capability. HSIN users require the capability to share information horizontally and vertically across diverse mission areas in a network of trust. Users gain uniform access to critical information through HSINs nationwide secure gateway and interoperability with selected trusted platforms.  Through HSIN, users gain access to timely and accurate information related to detecting, preventing, responding, and recovering from terrorist attacks and natural disasters; information regarding vulnerabilities and threats; information related to incident management to mitigate risks and reduce post incident loss of life and property;  and information related to emergency management response and recovery operations.",,"HSIN is used extensively to coordinate national security events, incident response, law enforcement activities and other homeland security operations. Whether supporting security operations, enabling real-time coordination for incidents and responses, or enabling intelligence analysis information sharing, HSINs benefits are in providing vital support to the homeland security enterprise. HSINs past year program costs in FY18 funding were about $22.970 million, including a large amount for operations and maintenance (O&M) support. In an effort to improve overall operations and reduce costs, the Program completed migration of the HSIN system to a private cloud infrastructure in July 2017 and closed down more expensive infrastructure services in DC-2. This resulted in $1.2 million in realized cost avoidance for the past year (July 2017  June 2018) and yielded an actual Return on Investment (ROI) of 1.05 overall. The calculation for HSINs actual ROI for the past year as a result of the cloud migration can be shown as $24.17 million potential costs over $22.97 million in actual costs (24.17/22.97 = 1.05). Estimates for cost avoidance for this year, FY19, are slightly above that of FY18, and continue on an increasing cost avoidance trend for the next four budget years.","Strategic requirements for this investment are derived in part from the National Strategy for Information Sharing, Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8 and the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review 2018. These directives and policies specify the need to strengthen the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation. In strengthening security, practices must be put into place to enable Federal departments and agencies to regularly share information and intelligence with other public and private entities in support of mission critical activities including: sharing information at the Federal level; sharing information with state, local, and tribal entities; and sharing information with the private sector and international partners. HSIN provides information sharing capabilities among DHS and its partners across the full spectrum of homeland security missions.

SEVIS tracks information on nonimmigrants who are participating in the U.S. education system or designated exchange visitor program throughout the duration of their approved stay. Nonimmigrants may temporarily come to the US to study under three classes of admission: F for academic and language students, M for vocational students, and J for exchange visitors. SEVIS greatly improved efficiencies by using electronic means to capture critical F/M/J nonimmigrant information in a centralized repository. The use of SEVIS increases data accuracy, reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information, improves the experience of school/program officials and nonimmigrants, and significantly increases data sharing across multiple government agencies reducing duplication of effort. Efficiencies are further improved through the ability of the web-based SEVIS application to be used in real-time for data updates and queries which reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information. SEVIS supports the DHS Mission by providing critical information needed to enforce immigration laws. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) within the ICE Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is the business sponsor that funds and manages SEVIS. SEVIS also supports the Department of State (DoS) Office of Private Sector Exchange in its mission. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides IT program and project management support to SEVP. Stakeholders include DHS ICE and DoS government users; customers are users from the academia and programs sponsoring F, M, or J status nonimmigrants; nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors and their dependents. In addition, SEVIS shares data with agencies and organizations systems including, DoS Consular ConsolidatedDatabase (CCD), USCIS Electronic Immigration System (ELIS), Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF), Department of Treasury I-901 Fee Pay system, Student and Exchange Visitor Program Automated Management System (SEVPAMS), CBP TECS, Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS).",,"Maintaining SEVIS's legacy system architecture has become untenable and provides sub-optimal business value. Consequently, an Analysis of Alternatives, confirmed by the SEVIS Modernization Oversight Board on 14 JAN 2016, identified a custom-built and cloud-hosted solution to be the best value for the government in terms of both cost and effectiveness. On a ten-year lifecycle starting FY2017, the chosen modernization alternative will cost approx. 20% more than the maintenance of the legacy O&M system, and yield a 90% increase in operational effectiveness. This yields a life-cycle ROI of 57%. The overall system quality will improve as part of the modernization efforts as well. The system will transition to maintain records that are associated with an individual nonimmigrant, rather than with a period of eligibility. The system will also be simpler to maintain as it will transition from proprietary technology and architecture to be supported by open-source technologies that will be supported outside of traditional data centers, and use a modern architecture based upon reusable services.","https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-act-2002
SEVIS supports the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. Legislative Mandates for SEVIS include the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 which directed the development and conduct of a program to collect certain information on nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors. Following the 9-11 attack Congress enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act). Section 416 mandated the full implementation of SEVIS by January 1, 2003. Congress enacted the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 in January 2003. This Act clarified procedures for collecting and managing information on nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 delegated responsibility of SEVIS to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and required that SEVIS information be used to carry out enforcement functions.
In 2006, the Homeland Security Council Policy Coordinating Committee (HSC PCC) reported on a variety of national security vulnerabilities related to the admission of nonimmigrant students, including several needed and at times critical SEVIS improvements. Concurrently, a data validation exercise made SEVP aware of some of the limitations in the data. In 2007, SEVP commissioned an independent study to evaluate the situation and identify possible remedies, one of which was the recommendation for a completely new system. Following a cancellation of the initial program to complete a new system for SEVIS, the program achieved a successful ADE 2A/2B decision in September 2016. This current modernization program will seek to modernize SEVIS in place, and focus efforts on closing the vulnerabilities identified by the 2006 HSC PCC report.",yes,no,yes,http://www.ice.gov/sevis/|https://sevis.ice.dhs.gov/sevis/,,Nisha Kaul,4 - Other certification with 4 or more years PM experience (within the last five years),371.128,49.598,,,,,,4 - initiate modernization/replacement action,4,"ICE Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is an Agile Acquisition Pilot Program that has all of its requisite acquisition documentation and attained its combined ADE-2A/B decision on September 22, 2016.

These two decisions by the ADA hastened the ability of the program identification of a severe funding issue. After developing the roadmap and conducting preliminary investigation into the fee funded account, the SEVP/SEVIS team soon realized that there was not enough funding to support both the legacy SEVIS system and the modernization efforts. ICE recognized the looming cost breach and decided that they would request a pause for the program. During the pause ICE will conduct a Post Implementation Review and will bring in a neutral party to assess the current state of the program and, if necessary, help the program to develop a new plan. ICE anticipates that funding should be available in mid-FY 2021. ICE CAE intends to affect changes with program staffing, explore alternative contracting strategies, and capture lessons learned.

OBIM, through IDENT, provides rapid, accurate, and secure identification information to USCIS; USCG; CBP; ICE; USSS; DHS OCSO; FEMA; TSA; CISA; DOS; DOJ; DoD; OPM; State, local, tribal, and territorial Law Enforcement;  Intelligence Community; and Foreign Country Partners. These services provide accurate and actionable information to customers who determine visa issuance and admissibility into the United States, establish eligibility for immigration benefits, conduct background checks, issue credentials, take law enforcement actions with potential homeland security implications, verify identity of persons associated with matters of national security, conduct intelligence and trend analysis, and grant access to sensitive facilities. As DHS demands for biometric identity services have grown and evolved, the legacy IDENT system has exceeded its original design. IDENT expanded its customer base and services provided to those customers by retrofitting functionalities and components to the existing foundation to meet urgent mission needs.",,"The demand for IDENT services continues to grow rapidly in response to the needs of system users and stakeholders. OBIM conducted multiple DHS and independent assessments and studies to identify required capabilities and to verify the gaps in the current system. While the large scale, unique, and complex IDENT system generally meets todays performance expectations, IDENT is at risk, and will not be able to meet DHS capability needs in the mid or long termsuch as servicing existing customers projected growth volumes or adding needed multimodal serviceslet alone support Congressional, Administration, or Departmental emergent priorities such as biometric exit. As a result, OBIM is pursuing the acquisition and development of HART to continue to provide biometric identity services to support DHS missions, and resolve critical system issues with the current IDENT system. The benefits of the replacement system include: addressing the mission failure risk of the legacy system; achieving operations and maintenance cost efficiencies; improving detection and derogatory information matching; providing multimodal biometric services. IDENT supports DHS QHSR findings and strategy for an integrated Homeland Security Enterprise for DHS and its components, other Federal departments, State, local, and tribal law enforcement, the intelligence community, and foreign partners. It is an integrated component of a networked Homeland Security Enterprise that addresses multi-threat, all-hazard security considerations. IDENT data and analysis helps secure and protect the U.S. against terrorism, enables data integration and analysis, supports and strengthens responsive immigration processing systems and law enforcement, minimizes disruptions to the trade and travel system, and supports a smarter, stronger border by enhancing our security infrastructure through support to new technologies. IDENT aligns with preventing terrorism and enhancing security, securing and managing our borders, and enforcing and administering our immigration laws as stated in the QHSR. IDENTs crosscutting mission alignments with the current and pending DHS Strategic Plans enables Department unity of effort.","OBIMs IDENT system, as an investment, meets legislative mandates such as P.L. 113-6 that designated OBIM as the lead entity within DHS responsible for biometric identity management services to ensure that the homeland is safe, secure, and resilient. Evolving from the US-VISIT program in 2013, OBIM serves as an enterprise-level service provider, with cross-cutting responsibilities to serve DHS Components and other mission partners such as the Departments of Justice (DOJ), State (DOS), and Defense (DOD); state, local, and tribal law enforcement; the Intelligence Community; and foreign government partners. Again in P.L. 113-76 this lead entity role is restated showing the critical importance of the investment (IDENT) in support the DHS mission. OBIM provides biometric identity services through the IDENT, which stores biometric identities and conducts recurrent matching against derogatory information. OBIM analysts also provide human biometric verification and search capabilities, updates to the IDENT biometric watchlist, and responses to requests for IDENT biometric records to support analytical, investigative, and operational needs of customers and partners.  By matching, storing, sharing, and analyzing biometric data, OBIM provides decision makers on the front lines of homeland security with rapid, accurate, and secure identity services as required by public law. This investment and OBIMs associated goals are aligned with the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) and DHS strategic goals and priorities, as well as with updated priorities outlined in the DHS 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and it does not have any outstanding audit or material weaknesses.

ADIS accomplishes this by matching automated entry & exit records of foreign nationals into a consolidated travel history, and by providing biographic identity & overstay status services to customers & stakeholders.  
ADIS goal - to prevent illegal entry, exit, and overstay - directly supports the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Reviews Mission Goals:  2.1 Effective Control of U.S. Air, Land, Sea Borders and Approaches, 2.2 Safeguard Lawful Trade and Travel, and 3.2 Prevent Unlawful Immigration.
  
ADIS qualitative benefits include assistance in determining admissibility, law enforcement action, Visa approval/denial, Visa Waiver Program eligibility, and the support for anticipated immigration reform and expansion of biometric and biographic exit activities.  The Investment benefits users by matching travel events with immigration status to provide an overstay status.  ADIS contributes to DHS Missions - 2) Secure & Manage Our Borders and 3) Enforce and Administer Our Immigration Laws - by looking at arrival & departure data collectively from multiple sources to determine whether a person departed the U.S. on time or if they legally extended their immigration status.
  
Internal DHS customers, who are also stakeholders, are CBP, OBIM, ICE, USCIS, TSA, & USCG. External customers, who are also stakeholders, include Department of State (DOS) and the intelligence community.  ADIS incorporates data elements & transactions associated with CBP systems & other immigration systems to create & maintain complete histories on 373M travelers & processes more than 3.3M transactions a day.  ADIS services are expanding - the Department of Commerce and Social Security Administration (SSA) are new customers expected in FY19 and includes a 24/7 help desk and system uptime of 98% or greater.  ADIS enables DHS to comply with Congressional, legislative, operational, and executive mandates by helping to determine if foreign nationals have overstayed terms of admission and enhances homeland security by providing a cost-effective response to the entry-exit statutory mandate to determine whether foreign nationals are legally in the U.S.",,"ADIS is an inherited post Full Operational Capability operational investment and as such does not have an identified ""return on investment.""  However, ADIS produces significant cost avoidance benefits to the nation that include enhanced border security & enforcement of U.S. immigration laws by serving as the Department's primary provider of overstay status and biographic identity services.  Deployed data exchange upgrades and matching process improvements shortened the overstay vetting process, reducing the time ICE takes to act on an overstay from 45 days to 15 or fewer days.  Enhancements to the overstay population also contributed to further data integrity improvements in the annual Congressional Overstay Report.  The efficiency gained is replacing a one-time yearly data call using significant manual resources with a modern real-time reporting environment.  The real time data exchange with the Intelligence Community also eliminates a one-month data delay and the need for manual/bulk data updates transferred historically by human courier.  Any delay in data touch points pointing to subjects arriving and departing the country creates a gap in information for making national security decisions.
  
By closing these information gaps, efficiencies are gained across the federal government in sharing data more effectively in a real time, leading to reduced analytic costs for the Intelligence Community in searching multiple systems for similar data and reduction in human resources needed to support the existing manual exchanges.  In 2019 and 2020, CBP plans to expand its data sharing capabilities with the Department of Commerce, Social Security Administration and other Government agencies and use the reporting environment for the statistics of the FY18 Entry/Exit Overstay Report.","ADIS supports DHS in meeting the below legislative mandates by demonstrating the capabilities requested by releasing the Entry/Exit Overstay Report each fiscal year:  https://www.dhs.gov/publication/entryexit-overstay-report

024-000005265,1876,01 - Major IT,01 - Not Applicable,"	024",Department of Homeland Security,"	58",U.S. Customs and Border Protection,CBP - Biometric Entry-Exit,"Biometric Entry-Exits purpose is to deploy a biometric matching service that provides the capability to biometrically confirm the identity of in-scope travelers arriving and departing the United States (U.S.) at air, land, and sea ports. This service enables biometric identity verification by using the travelers facial image compared to photos existing in government image repositories. Currently, CBP confirms a travelers arrival and departure at air and sea ports using the biographic information on a government-issued document, such as a passport. The addition of biometric matching provides greater assurance of the identity of the traveler. At land ports of entry (POE), CBP has had no feasible way to determine a departing travelers identity using biographic information since this information has not been required to leave the country. The goal is to provide greater assurance of traveler identity through biometric confirmation to achieved four primary benefits: 1) enhanced ability to confirm that a non-U.S. citizen has complied with the terms of admission to the U.S.; 2) more effective identification of travelers who have overstayed their lawful period of admission and may be subject to additional scrutiny when applying for a visa or a travel authorization to return to the U.S.; 3) strengthened capability to interdict and deter the fraudulent use of travel documents and identify individuals who may be subject to law enforcement action; 4) improved accuracy of the annual DHS Entry/Exit Overstay Report required by Congress. CBP stakeholders are using the initial delivery of a biometric matching service, but new iterations are being tested to involve other key DHS stakeholders and customers--Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA). CBP and the DHS Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) work together to share information that can help expand DHS biometric capabilities to meet the needs for any DHS component.Airlines, ocean cruise lines, and air and sea port authorities are the key private sector and organizational customers for the biometric matching service. The travelling public will benefit from a more streamlined and secure travel process while airlines benefit from the backend infrastructure developed by the federal government that assists in confirmation of travelers entering and exiting the country.",,"Based on data collected to date, the Biometric Entry-Exit investment may provide significant return on investment (ROI) by developing and deploying the Traveler Verification Service (TVS), a biometric matching service, which utilizes cloud services and an agile development approach. This enables the rapid deployment of a comprehensive biometric entry and exit solution. TVS will provide biometric matching services for all travel modes including air, land and sea. The qualitative benefits deriving from this comprehensive solution are being realized today in the commercial air exit environment. The solution builds on a partnership with the air travel industry based on a cost-sharing model with airlines and airports. In this partnership, CBP is working with air transportation stakeholders to lead the transformation of air travel using biometrics as the key to enhancing security, and dramatically improve the entire traveler experience. CBP is realizing the benefit of a greater assurance of traveler identity through the use of biometrics without negatively impacting the airline boarding process, For example, one of CBPs biometric exit partners has reported that the new process allows it to reduce boarding time of an A380, the largest passenger plane in operation, from 50 to 20 minutes. In this partnership, airports or airlines purchase, operate, and maintain the biometric capture device at each departure gate. Each device costs on average $30,000-$40,000 for each of the 2,000 gates where this equipment is installed. Additionally, airports are updating existing infrastructure and network connections and developing their own software to communicate with CBPs TVS. The program conservatively estimates a cost savings of $60 million just in the procurement of the biometric capture devices -- a significant quantitative benefit. Additional cost savings will be further realized as airlines and airports operate and maintain the devices along with any infrastructure investments. For air entry operations, CBPs new simplified arrival process quickly and reliably uses the travelers face to biometrically verify identity and retrieve traveler records automatically. Current data shows that arriving passengers clear customs processing 35 percent faster with the new biometric process that eliminates manual, time consuming steps such as document scans and fingerprint captures, which delay the inspection process. With a faster clearance process, airlines, airports, and travelers benefit from shorter connection times and standardized arrival procedures. In land operations, CBP is exploring through technology demonstrations the use of a gallery of expected border crossers and validating the concept of face as a token to close the arrival/departure reporting gap in the pedestrian and vehicle environment. Additional benefits that may be realized include replacing the use of travel documents to facilitate the border crossing experience. Unlike the air environment, CBP will procure, operate, and maintain biometric capture devices. As the technology demonstrations continue, the program will identify all costs associated with the deployment of this capability at CBPs land ports of entry. Since sea and air operations are similar, CBP is using the air exit model and the establishment of a partnership with cruise line operators who will procure, operate, and maintain the biometric capture devices.","The Biometric Entry-Exit investment was established in response to the 9/11 Commission Report, Section 12.4, pp. 383-89 (http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch12.pdf) which detailed the inability to verify traveler identity upon departure from the U.S. and the Commission's recommendation to build a biometric entry-exit system which is an essential investment in our national security. A key driver for the program is the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113, 410(g), 129 STAT. 3006, https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ113/PLAW-114publ113.pdf ), in which Congress established a biometric entry-exit fee that will provide up to $1 billion in funding over a 10-year period.  An additional driver is Executive Order 13780, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States issued on March 6, 2017 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/09/2017-04837/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states), which directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expedite the implementation of the biometric entry-exit system.
To meet these mandates, CBP is deploying the TVS to enable biometric matching using the travelers facial image at departure from U.S. air, land, and sea ports. In the air environment, CBP is working with airlines and airport authorities to deploy facial image cameras that will collect traveler photos in the jetway, pass the photo to TVS, and return a board / no-board response to the camera. In a case of a no-board, instructions are provided to local CBP Officers on what actions need to be taken to allow the traveler to board or if other law enforcement action is required. CBP will deploy a capability at seaports similar to that used in airports and is working with ocean cruise lines to incorporate this biometric matching capability into the boarding process.  In the land environment, CBP is assessing how facial images will be captured from individuals leaving the country by foot or vehicle and is designing technology demonstrations that will further detail operational requirements.",yes,yes,yes,,,Colleen Manaher,1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior,72.62,90.55,,,,,,,4,"The goal of Biometric Entry-Exit Program is to enhance the integrity of the immigration system by verifying travelers identities. On April 25, 2017, the Acquisition Review Board (ARB) reviewed the Biometric Entry-Exit Program and granted the Program ADE-1 approval. The program was also granted permission to continue testing the Biometric Air Exit pilot at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and to conduct technology demonstrations as needed.
All required ADE-2A acquisition documents were approved and the program received ADE-2A approval for Air Exit during an ARB held on May 2, 2018. As an action from the ARB, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established a Biometrics Executive Steering Committee (ESC), which is designed to support appropriate relationships between DHS biometric programs, including CBP, OBIM, and others. The Air Exit portion of the program completed ADE-2B activity in November 2018 as documented in ADM dated December 21, 2018. The ADE-2B was supported by finalization of the Integrated Logistics Support Plan and Test and Evaluation Master Plan, as well as an updated Certification of Funds memo and Integrated Master Schedule.
The program faces funding challenges due to decreasing fee collections. This impact can be minimized in the short-term with carryover funds and reduction in enforcement officers, but long-term funding solutions will be necessary to address the funding short-fall and the termination of fee funding in 2025.
The program achieved and surpassed its IOC requirement of 30 international flights per day within the APB threshold of Q1 FY 2019. IOT+E is currently planned for completion in May 2019, to support an ADE-3 for Air Exit in September 2019. Technology demonstrations are continuing in the sea and land environments. CBP shall submit technology demonstration plans in Q3 FY 2019 to inform technology demonstrator selection, purpose, and objectives, approach for test and evaluation, success criteria, synergy between pilots, efficacy of the pilots to future program decisions, and life cycle sustainment or product disposition as appropriate for all travel modalities.

The largest financial and technical system within this investment is NFIP Information Technology Systems (ITS) which is supported by legacy mainframe technologies application that processes all the Write-Your-Own (WYO) insurance company flood policy and claims transactions.  Without the capability embodied by the IT S&S investment, the NFIP would be unable to process flood insurance policies and claims for more than 5.3 million flood policies.  The Investment IT S&S also includes a few other smaller systems including the Reinsurance Broker System (RBS) and the NFIP Direct Services Agent (DSA) which contribute to the overall NFIP business. Without the capability embodied by the IT S&S investment, the NFIP would be unable to process flood insurance policies and claims for more than 5.3 million flood policies.   
  
The IT S&S investment is critical to mission attainment, helping facilitate flood insurance transactions like policy issuance and claims payments to flood survivors.   IT S&S supports the following DHS and FEMA missions and strategic goals: DHS Mission 5 (Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience), Strategic Goal 1 (Build a Culture of Preparedness), Objective 1.1 (Incentive investments that reduce risk) and Objective 1.2 (Close the Insurance Gap), and FEMA Strategic Goal 2 (Ready the Nation for Catastrophic Disasters). The key benefit of this investment is the continued operation of the NFIP and implementation of legislative reforms from Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 and the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.   
  
Key investment stakeholders include: policyholders, FEMA components, FIMA, the Direct Servicing Agent, WYO Insurance companies, insurance vendors, adjusters, insurance agents, communities, and others. It is important tonote this investment is slated for disposal/decommission and to be replaced by Pivot; described in its' own investment with UII 07128. This investment will be retired as the NFIP system of record in BY20 and fully disposed in BY21.",,"The IT S&S is an investment in sustainment that has been operational since 1983.  As such, no ROI has been formally quantified.  The NFIP IT S&S has been in production for over 30 years.  Given this length of time, it is likely that this system has provided a very favorable return on its original investment.  Additionally, this system allows the NFIP to sell flood insurance and pay claims to U.S. persons in a time of flooding disaster. However, it is important to note that ITS&S is being modernized and replaced by Pivot (UII 7128) and the ROI for this investment has been recently calculated. 
 
As described in responses to accomplishment questions later in the business case the continued operation of the Legacy Support System (ITS) is critical to the day-to-day operation of the NFIP as are the support functions provided by the continued work funded under the BSA contract. Until the new SOR is available under Pivot, both are critical to NFIPs ability to update program documentation; respond to flooding disasters by opening Flood Response Offices (FRO), and providing training to key stakeholders, including claims adjusters. This investment benefits the general public by serving as the System of Record for over 5 million policyholders and more than 22,000 participating communities. In addition to the participating communities those who boarder those communities receive a heighted awareness of flooding. Without the continued operation of the IT S&S, FEMA would be unable to provide flood coverage, which ensures policyholders have access to insurance payments in the event of flooding disasters. More over the taxpayers are rarely contributing to the NFIP due to being funded through the premiums the policyholders pay .","Currently there are no Outstanding Audit findings or Material weaknesses.

The Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) was created by Executive Order 13411 for the purpose of improving the delivery of assistance to survivors of disasters. The goals of the program are: to provide disaster survivors a portal to all available forms of assistance, to provide federal agencies an effective automated data interchange, to reduce costs, and to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse. The benefits of investment in DAIP include:  eased burden on disaster survivors, improved service delivery and reduced duplicative costs by multiple agencies. DAIP provides a central portal reducing the cost and technical barriers to participation for federal agencies; increasing the number and types of assistance available, streamlining delivery of services and improving internal controls. 
 
Contribution to Mission Delivery: 
DAIP supports the DHS strategic goal tied to both the QHSR and the DHS multi-year Strategic Plan. DAIP Supports DHS Mission 5: Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience and FEMAs core mission of Helping people before, during, and after disasters. DAIP is directly engaged with activities to support FEMAs strategic goals, especially Goal 3: Reduce the Complexity of FEMA. DAIP supports DHS FEMAs efforts to comply with the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. 
Key Customers, Stakeholders, and Other Beneficiaries: 
 
Beneficiaries of the DAIP and DisasterAssistance.gov are the survivors of disasters (American tax payers, the general public and small businesses). Stakeholders of DAIP include 17 Federal Agencies such as FEMA, DHS, SBA, HUD, and SSA. The beneficiaries and primary users of DAIP (DisasterAssistance.gov) are survivors of federally declared disasters, the American tax payer, the general public, small businesses, local communities, and the 17 federal agency stakeholders that sponsor the program. Collaboration with other agencies through DAIP ensuresa coordinated Federal approach to the delivery of disaster assistance. DAIP collaborates with nonprofit organizations and tribal, state, and local governments to identify additional resources to include on the portal that would be beneficial to disaster survivors.",,"The Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) was created in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to alleviate disaster survivors frustration when dealing with multiple federal programs and to ensure survivors receive prompt and efficient access to federal disaster assistance. DAIP measures program value by consistently monitoring performance to demonstrate the program is meeting the needs of the Agency and to ensure the program delivers expected value. DAIP is reducing costs and improving efficiencies by streamlining and consolidating the delivery of disaster assistance to survivors.  This single, online application eases the burden on disaster survivors and increases their access to disaster relief by creating a continually updated information clearinghouse that provides information on the benefits most valuable to a disaster survivor, such as housing, food and employment aid in both English and Spanish. DisasterAssistance.gov reduces the time needed to apply for aid and check the status of claims while decreasing redundancy in application forms and processes. DAIPs web portal provides cost avoidance to FEMA for every registration or account inquiry done on-line or mobile device over traditional call-center or in-person applications. As shown in the Hurricane Sandy response, the DisasterAssistance.gov portal provides a cost effective alternative to increasing call center capacity and volume without any additional cost to the American Taxpayer. DAIP improves government efficiencies at FEMA, DHS and across the federal government.  This investment centralizes multiple disaster survivor databases, application processes and information channels thereby improving utilization and efficiency.  DAIPs application processing allows for survivors to apply for multiple forms of assistance across multiple agencies and programs with built in protections against waste, fraud and abuse. For the period of actual and simulated activity, the sum of planning costs is $34.037M, DME, excluding planning costs, are $66.885M. O&M costs are $166.507M, for a total AoA Life Cycle Cost of $267.430M. The values of six benefit classifications have been evaluated. The AoA conducted in FY 2015 was based across the time span FY 2015 through FY 2023, DAIP has projected net benefits of $687.036M offset by a costs of $134.315M yielding a simple ROI of 4.11%, that is, each dollar invested returns greater than four dollars.  These benefits are split between the taxpayer in reduced costs and additional services provided to the disaster survivor. The benefits of investing in DAIP will continue to improve service delivery, assist survivors and reduce duplicative costs by multiple agencies. Since the primary focus and mission of DAIP is to expedite and improve the delivery of assistance to survivors of disasters, virtually every operational performance metric associated with DAIP is related to customer satisfaction. These performance metrics are monitored and updated every month and illustrate a consistent level of performance in delivering improved access to disaster resources (especially compared with pre-Katrina processes and timelines). The current DAIP modernization effort will ensure that the Program continues to fulfill its charter to ease the burden on disaster survivors by providing them with a portal to all available forms of assistance, to provide federal agencies an effective automated data interchange, to reduce costs, and to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse.","Presidential Direction (i.e. Presidential Directive, Presidential Memorandum, or Executive Order): The Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP) was the direct result of Executive Order 13411, which directs the federal government to improve the delivery of assistance to disaster survivors by providing a centralized application process for Federal disaster assistance, providing a centralized and continuously updated clearinghouse from which disaster survivors may obtain information regarding Federal disaster assistance, and state and local government and private sector sources of disaster assistance, and reducing fraud, waste, and abuse.  https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/13411.pdf

The IPAWS mission provides integrated services and capabilities to Federal, State, Territorial, Tribal, and Local authorities enabling them to alert and warn their respective communities. IPAWS program goals established to accomplish the mission: 1) Create, maintain and evolve an integrated interoperable environment for alert and warning; 2) Make alert and warning more effective; and 3) Strengthen the resilience of IPAWS infrastructure. Key IPAWS benefits are expanded capability and cost savings for local authorities leveraging IPAWS to distribute warning to local populations via cellular phone, radio & television, NOAA Weather Radio, and Internet applications, and a resilient capability for the President to warn the nation under all-hazards scenarios. IPAWS supports QHSR ""Mission 5: Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience"" and DHS ""Goal 5.3: Ensure Effective Emergency Response"". Public Information and Warning is a core capability to the National Preparedness Goal. Core capabilities are essential for the execution of each of the five mission areas: Prevention, Protection, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery. IPAWS is a national tool used by local, state, territorial and federal authorities to provide timely and effective warnings to people to reduce the loss of life and property and lower the cost of future disasters. Key customers of IPAWS are local, state, and federal authorities that send public alerts directly to citizens' cellular phones, radios, televisions, weather radios, and Internet connected devices. As of June 2018, 1,100 public alerting authorities (total states, territorial, local, tribal, & federal agencies) are using IPAWS. The National Weather Service and the DoJ National Center for Missing and Exploited Children are key stakeholders using the IPAWS to deliver weather and AMBER alerts across the nation. Additional key stakeholders include radio and TV broadcast, cable industry and the wireless service provider industry which depend upon IPAWS operations to meet federal regulatory requirements. The IPAWS primary beneficiaries are people who receive alerts enabling them to avoid danger, protect property, and save the lives of themselves and others.",,"ROI was calculated by dividing External Benefits by Total Program Cost (per signed LCCE, Dec 2016): ($688,218,000/$470,794,446.25)  1 = 0.46. An ROI of .46 indicates that IPAWS increases benefits to society such that the initial investment is recovered & a return (savings in excess of original investment) is incurred. We defined External Benefits as estimated cost savings for federal agencies using IPAWS & the value of advanced/post alerts and warnings in the preservation of life and protection of property. This calculation uses quantitative analysis to capture both quantitative & qualitative benefits resulting from IPAWS.  
  
Cost Savings for Federal Agencies: IPAWS is free for public safety officials at all levels & allows users to leverage the federal investment to send alerts & warning to citizens. NCMEC cancelled a cellular alerting contract valued at approx. $1M/year when the AMBER Alert capability via IPAWS was initiated in Dec 2012. Estimated cost for the National Weather Service to implement a national cellular alerting capability independent of IPAWS is estimated at $2M/year. Numerous other state & local authorities have benefitted from the federal investment in IPAWS as a national standard for alert and warning vice independently investing in unique alert & warning capabilities on their own.  
  
Lives Saved by IPAWS: In our research we learned that weather warnings issued in response to tornadoes & hurricanes have been highly effective in providing advance warnings with protective action information to allow people to evacuate or seek shelter. IPAWS evaluated tornado & hurricane fatalities & found a significant decrease in loss of life and severe injuries over the last 9 years, compared to the same period prior to the launch of IPAWS. Since we cannot definitively attribute this difference to IPAWS, we conservatively attribute 10% of the difference in lives saved per year to IPAWS, resulting in 71.67 lives. Combined with the 53 children rescued as a direct result of AMBER Alerts sent through WEA (data from NCMEC, 3/20/18) this gives us a total of 124.67 lives saved by IPAWS.  
 
IPAWS plans to improve the amount of time IPAWS infrastructure is available for use & the time it takes to disseminate alerts & warnings to the public upon receipt. This enhances effectiveness & efficiency of warning messages to all people in a danger area, increasing the likelihood that people receive immediate warning information to afford the maximum amount of time to take action and avoid or mitigate the impact of disaster. Disaster impact avoidance & mitigation benefits society by enabling people to take protective measures, saving lives & reducing the cost of response & recovery activities after a disaster.  
  
IPAWS also aims to increase population covered by PEP Stations & local level public safety officials with IPAWS access. The integrated interoperable systems & open standards interfaces create a simple gateway between public safety officials & multiple communications systems supporting access to public alert & warning messages.

The ROI formula has too many unpredictable components to be calculated precisely, but an ROI qualitative analysis is useful:
ROI=(((Original Baseline O&M - New Total O&M) + Other Benefits to Society)/Acquisition Cost Only)-1
   
The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2028 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)
   
Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in benefits to society.
 Previous O&M = averaged $21.069M
 New O&M = $25.302M
With increasing resource costs, O&M costs are not anticipated to decrease.
 System cost Benefits = $5M
 Public Benefits > $20M
  
ROI = (((29.854M-24.883M)+385.550M)/102.017)-1 = 283%

These statutes require DHS to prevent individuals from entering a secure area of a vessel or facility unless the individual holds a transportation security card or is accompanied by another individual who holds a card.
 Contribution to Mission Delivery or Agency Management Support Functions: In accordance with the DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog, Version 2.0, dated June 2014, the TWIC program supports the PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY Mission and the Screening function as listed in the Capability Portfolio.  As of April 19, 2018, more than 4.8 million workers had applied for a TWIC.
 Goals: The TWIC program provides a vital security measure to ensure that individuals who pose a security threat do not gain unescorted access to secure areas of the nations maritime transportation industry. 
 Current or Anticipated Benefits: TSA (1) positively verifies each applicants claimed identity; (2) performs a security threat assessment on each applicant; and (3) produces and issues a TWIC card containing biometric and physical information for each applicant meeting the threat assessment eligibility requirements. The TWIC security threat assessment provides a terrorism/intelligence check, a criminal history records check, and an immigration check. TWICs are tamper-resistant biometric credentials. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential in compliance with regulatory requirements.
 Key Customers: Facility employees, longshoremen, merchant mariners, deckhands, long haul and drayage truck drivers, laborers, chemical facility workers, and others requiring unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels.
 Stakeholdersand other Beneficiaries:  Extensive outreach to Congress; American Association of Port Authorities; National Association of Waterfront Employers; American Trucking Association; American Waterways Operators; Offshore Marine Service Association; Passenger Vessel Association; Intermodal Association of North America; International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union; Chemical Sector Coordinating Council (SCC), and others including the approximately 2800 MTSA-regulated facilities and 10,000 regulated vessels.",,"The benefit of the TWIC program is that it improves security by a common nation-wide secure biometric credential that is used by operators of the national maritime transportation infrastructure to make access control decisions. The TWIC program established standards and processes for enrollment, vetting, adjudication, redress, card issuance and activation.  In addition, TSA continuously monitors all TWIC holders for terrorism risks and revokes credentials when the individual is no longer eligible for TWIC.  The TWIC program currently reports 7 key performance metrics:  Average Adjudication Total Accuracy Rate, Invalid Enrollment Rate, Customer Satisfaction, Average Wait Time, Operational Availability, Program Financial Commitment Variance, and Program Viability.  The TWIC program continually reviews metrics and in 2018, the TWIC program continues to evaluate existing performance measures to develop more effective metrics aligned with program objectives.  
 To calculate ROI, the program did a cash flow analysis using the TWIC Funding History report published by the TSA CFO which has the history of funding for the program up to September 30, 2017.  ROI for the TWIC program is calculated as (Cash In  Cash Out)/Cash Out.  Cash In is derived from two sources, appropriated funding provided early in the program and fee revenue collected from transportation workers once the program reached operational capability.  Consequently, as of September 30, 2017, Cash In (Appropriations) $155.875M + Cash In (Fees) $854.658M = $1010.533M; Cash Out (Expenses) = $538.069M; therefore, ROI = ($1010.533M-$538.069M)/$538.069M = 87.81%.  The details for this method are included in the first tab of the TWIC Funding History report which is uploaded.","Legislative Mandate:  The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2002 requires DHS to issue a biometric transportation security card to those requiring unescorted access to MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels after determining the individual does not pose a security risk.  The TWIC program provides a secure credential and biometric security card for eligible transportation workers who require unescorted access to areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels.  TWIC positively identifies applicants by determining the authenticity of identity documentation, and it conducts a Security Threat Assessment (STA) on each individual, including continuous vetting against Terrorist Screening Databases.
 
 Agency Strategic Plan:  TWIC supports DHS Strategic Goal 1.1  Prevent Terrorist Attacks and Goal 1.3 Reduce Risk to the Nations Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events.  Via enrollment and vetting processes, TWIC prevents ineligible applicants from obtaining a TWIC card.   Also, TWIC supports TSA Strategic Goal 1.0 - Establish a risk-based approach to all operations to identify, manage, and mitigate risk in all TSA lines of business, and Goal 2.0 - External Engagement - Sustain transparent and proactive relationships with external stakeholders and the traveling public.  The TWIC programs enrollment, vetting, and adjudication processes maintain effective controls to mitigate the risk of an ineligible applicant obtaining a TWIC card.  The TWIC program uses customer service strategies, a stakeholder communications committee, visits to individual facilities and Coast Guard districts/sectors, and speaking at national stakeholder conferences and meetings to maintain communication with transportation workers and maritime industry representatives.
 Outstanding GAO Audit:   FY17, the TWIC program contracted a Federally Funded Research Development Center (FFRDC) to address a GAO recommendation to perform an internal control assessment .  The assessment was completed in Dec 2017 and examined the program's internal control strengths, risks, and vulnerabilities.

The TIM Program mission is aligned and consistent with the overarching DHS and TSA mission, DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security. The TIM System supports operations by reducing the probability of a successful terrorist attack on the transportation system by applying threat assessment methodologies intended to identify known or suspected terrorist threats working in or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system.
 TIM was originally built and operated in the DHS Datacenter cloud environment. TIM is a fully integrated system utilizing service oriented architecture capable of providing more effective and efficient security threat assessments to all transportation sectors including: surface, maritime and aviation. TIM is the Security Threat Assessment infrastructure focal point for stakeholders including: Congress, FBI, State Department, Coast Guard, State & Local agencies, U.S. airports, U.S. ports, as well as transportation employers, transportation employees, and travelers.
 The TIM programs goals are to improve customer service, provide one-stop shopping, enable a person-centric view, to implement enroll, once and use many, to increase the efficiency of security threat assessments and information sharing with federal, state, local authorities and industry partners, to promote secure operations, to support fee-fairness and comparability between credentials for  transportation workers, and to realize economies of scale; as well as operational efficiencies through integration of processes.
 TIM customers (transportation workers and travelers) will benefit from the efficiencies and cost avoidance once TIM is fully implemented. Workers and travelers will also experience improved service at a lower cost. TIM is poised to be an Enterprise-level solution for ScreeningCoordination Office (SCO) Credentialing Framework Initiatives (CFI). TIM was one of the first DHS programs to use DHS Data Center Cloud Services. In FY18, TIM was migrated to enclaves in DC1 & CSOC.  TIM is a DHS agile pilot program that enables agile responses to changing business conditions and operational requirements via engineered business processes, and seamless information sharing services based on managed data (accurate, timely, trustable) with tuned IT performance.",,"TIM is a Performing Program.  Though not fully implemented yet, the TIM Program already eliminates redundant business practices and processes, TIM will also achieve cost and performance efficiencies by integrating now separate IT systems (TWIC, Consolidated Screening Gateway, Screening Gateway, Crew Vetting, Alien Flight Student Program) functionality under one program.  TIM enables support for external stakeholders such as Maritime, Surface, and Aviation transportation worker / traveler populations.
 As demonstrated by reporting on operational performance metrics 230776 (Unit Cost of Processing ...) and 214428 (Operational Availability ...), TIM provides TSA internal benefits by enabling information sharing across TSA / DHS .  Additionally, with the implementation of the re-baseline, and the introduction of additional populations beyond Maritime, TIM will commence reporting on Operational Performance metrics 214427 (Enroll Once Use Many...), and 214431 (Security Threat Assessment Response Time...).
 The TIM system was designed to function in a cloud environment.  TIM's infrastructure will result in significant cost savings, especially in future years during the O&M phase.  These savings will be evidenced by metrics 214427, 214428, 214429 (Cases automatically processed ...), and 214430 (MTBF).  Benefits to external stakeholders include streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person-centric which will be documented by metric 214427, and 230776.
 TIM is person centric in that the system recognizes workers applying for multiple credentials, endorsemen+D88ts, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation modes.  This person-centric capability enables TSA to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities which saves users time and money.
 TIM's STA process uses biometric and biographic information to perform automated immigration, criminal history,finger print, and terrorist watch list checks.  The transportation worker must have an approved STA to start or continue work, or even to apply for a job within the US transportation infrastructure.  Any significant delays impact the worker and may also impact commerce.","Maritime Transportation Security Act.

As of May 31, 2017, the R21 system is deployed and operational over approximately 260,000 square miles of coverage in 37 Coast Guard Sectors, which were delivered by the prime contractor.",,"The R21 Return on Investment (ROI) was determined by a Cost Analysis dtd March 2005; the cost analysis demonstrated a ROI of 3.05 and a payback period of 13 years. In determining the ROI, the R21 Key Decision Point (KDP) 1 was completed in Jul 1995 and authorized entry into the programs Concept and Technology Demonstration phase under the authority of DOT. In Aug 1999, KDP2 authorized the program to proceed into the Capability Development and Demonstration phase. In Aug 2001, the Coast Guard awarded three R21 Phase I contracts to competing contractors to develop proposed system designs. The Phase I proposals were reviewed in late 2001 and the Phase II production contract RFP was issued in Feb 2002. Following a formal source selection process, the USCGs Source Selection Official (SSO) awarded the R21 Phase II production contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems in Sep 2002. In Jul 2005, DHS authorized the R21 program to proceed into the Production and Deployment phase and full rate production subsequently commenced in Sep 2005.   Internal Benefits: R21 is used to tailor CG response (including coordinating with local first responders and federal coordinators), significantly reducing response time to mariners in distress. The R21 system enhances the CGs ability to detect & respond to distress calls in the coastal zone, which directly benefits the U.S. publics marine safety & saves lives. Benefits also include system disaster recovery capabilities that have supported coordination in numerous federals regional response and remediation efforts by providing a critical communication backbone in the disaster regions. For example, the R21 system provided a communication system that supported efforts to re-open ports in NY and NJ after hurricane Sandy.   External Benefits of the R21 system: Provides capabilities to help ensure the successful outcome of Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. By May 2017, R21 has been used in more than 94,730 SAR cases. Advanced DF which moreaccurately identifies the location of callers with lines of bearing to the VHF radio transmission source which reduces response time & search area; Continuous, enhanced VHF-FM marine radio coverage out to 20 nautical miles from shore; improved ability to identify suspected hoax calls; Increases the number of voice channels; Digital voice recording w/ immediate playback; Timely flow of info between CG & other stakeholders. The R21 investment is slated to reach the breakeven point in 2018.","MTSA of 2002 (Pub L 107-295) Section 346: The R21 investment is derived from the Maritime Transportation Security ACT (MTSA) of 2002(Pub. L. 107-295) Section 346. R21 is a DHS Level 1 Command, Control, & Communications (C3) system capital investment that replaced the CGs antiquated legacy National Distress and Response Systems (NDRS) and greatly enhances the CGs ability to execute missions in the coastal zone and is essential to meet the Service's search and rescue mission-program performance goals.

NAIS is a data collection, processing and distribution system that provides international Maritime Organization (IMO)-adopted Automatic Identification System (AIS) information to enhance safety of navigation and our Marine Transportation System (MTS), and improve Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The project provides the necessary capability to ensure the effective exchange of information  between AIS-equipped vessels, aircraft, ATON, and shore stations within all major U.S. ports, waterways, and coastal zones.  It integrates a network of AIS receivers and transmitters, data processing and storage centers, and user interface services that capture, exchange, and analyze data of critical interest for maritime safety and security.  Data collected supports the nation's maritime interest, from the safety of vessels and ports through collision avoidance, to the safety of the nation through detection, traffic identification, and classification of vessels.
Benefits/Stakeholders:
The data collected by NAIS will be shared with other pertinent stakeholders and decision makers in support of maritime security at critical ports.  NAIS supports a layered defense and requirements for Advanced Notice of Arrival by correlating AIS data with target vessel reporting and other maritime awareness data to focus resources on higher interest vessels.  The key customers and primary beneficiaries of NAIS include: USCG, CBP, Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, IRS, indirectly to the international community through MSSIS, and port partners.  Maritime Operational Threat Response benefits in achieving a coordinated U.S. Government response to threats to the US in the maritime domain.  NAIS will facilitate the Coast Guard response to threats in the maritime domain by enabling better visibility of suspect vessels as well as other vessels in the vicinity.  NAIS will allow for visibility and tracking of U.S. Government vessel assets for improved overall coordination of resources.  Maritime Communications benefits are associated with improved USCG ability to communicate with vessels in support of various USCG missions.  These benefits include the enhanced exchange of navigation information, improved communications interoperability with foreign vessels and other Government agencies' vessels, and backup capability to the Rescue 21 voice systems via AIS messaging.  The following USCG systems are dependent upon NAIS: IOC,  WebCOP, eGIS, MISLE, and MAGNet.",,"NAIS improves maritime domain awareness and offers improvements in collision avoidance, maritime safety, environmental protection and national security through the detection, classification and tracking of vessels whether they are in national water or still thousands of miles off shore.  
The ROI of 7.94, as calculated in the NAIS Alternatives Analysis of Dec 29, 2006, was calculated by determining the sum of the present value of all benefits and dividing it by the sum of the present value of all costs of each capability.  The benefits of security risk reduction (such as detection of large commercial vessel introduces WMD into US port and fishing vessel has a crew member onboard suspected of being a terrorist) are included in the ROI calculation.  The benefits of operational performance (such as improved Search and Rescue detection and response and collision detection and enforcement) have not been included because the confidence in those calculations was low; however if they were to be included, the ROI would be even higher.  The benefits were calculated for the following capabilities provided by NAIS: coastal receive, coastal transmit, long range receive, advanced data capability, and inland waters receive and transmit.  For each capability a variety of scenarios were evaluated using probabilities of occurrence and consequence costs to demonstrate the improvement in security risk by implementing NAIS.  
The present value of all costs of each capability was calculated using the LCCE produced as part of the NAIS Alternatives Analysis document.  The total benefit was calculated as $5,704,345,592; the total LCC was calculated as $718,062,000; the ROI was calculated as 7.94.  
While 7.94 is the ROI for the whole NAIS system, each Increment offers improvements in each capability to differing degrees.  Increment 1 primarily benefits coastal receive.  After recapitalization of Increment 1 with Increment 2, the return on investment is significant improvement of marine safety and security by increasing receive coverage from 24nm to 50 nm, the addition of transmit capability out to 24 nm, and advanced data capability.  Increment 3 primarily benefits long range receive.","NAIS derives from the U.S. obligations under Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974,  an international treaty, calls for automatic identification system of vessels; Maritime Transportation Safety Act (MTSA) Act of 2002 which is CG efforts in improving its knowledge of the ships calling at U.S. ports as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).

All financial transactions are consolidated in the CAS suite so that information can be reported to the Department of Homeland Security. This system handles an annual average of 36 million transactions.
 
Goal: The goal of CAS is to process financial data and generate reports and statements to meet federal requirements.  The CAS Suite, made up of applications in addition to CAS includes: Oracle Federal Financials (OFF) (a commercial off-the-shelf, product that includes - accounts receivable, assets, projects, inventory, accounts payable, purchasing, and general ledger), Sunflower (property management system used by the Transportation Security Agency), Finance and Procurement Desktop (FPD) (enterprise-wide accounting and procurement system assigned to assist in funds and procurement management), Workflow Imaging Network System (WINS) (imaging and document processing system), and Contract Information Management System (CIMS) (contract management using PRISM).
 
Benefit: The benefits of the CAS suite involves the analytical evaluation of projects and programs quantitatively, which improves project and program efficiencies and effectiveness, integrating all aspects of accounting and budget requirements for projects and programs.  The CAS suite tracks the financial cost of purchases, delivers, payments, and expenditures, making data management more efficient and report inquires readily available to users and managers.
Investment: The investment in the CAS suite supports all the critical operational activities of two major components within the Department of Homeland Security by recording and accounting for transactions.  Moreover, the CAS suite serves as an enterprise accounting, procurement, assets and management decision support system.
Support Function:The CAS suite supports the DHS missions and all USCG missions by providing the capability to procure goods and services that directly support the missions.
Key customers, stakeholder, and other beneficiaries: The agency management support function of the CAS suite is to service over 2,400 commands and field units throughout the U.S. Coast Guard and Transportation Security Agency.  The CAS suite monitors the scope of activities to be covered by accounting and financial systems.",,"Return on Investment: This legacy system has been deployed for over thirteen years, supporting the financial and procurement transactions for three DHS components. By this fact alone, DHS, CG and TSA leadership agree that CAS provides positive ROI, but the ROI has diminished over the years due to obsolescence and security risks. Calculating the current ROI on this legacy system would require significant time and resources.  For a system that is planned for disposition, the time and resources required to calculate the current ROI have been reallocated by leadership for continued sustainment of the system. It should be noted that the CAS Suite is planned for disposal after all data is either converted and migrated to FMSII or transferred into the planned FMPDR after the USCG and TSA successfully go live on FMSII. 
Benefits Internal (Government): A benefit of the CAS suite is that the system supports  accounting, asset management, and procurement system for the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Agency. All financial transactions are consolidated in the CAS suite so that information can be reported to the Department of Homeland Security in a timely manner. The CAS suite records and tracks accounting and financial activities, ensuring that legislative, Government Accounting Office, Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Homeland Security requirements are captured. 
  
Benefits External (General Public):  The external benefits stems on continued service to the general public regarding support from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Agency. These Department of Homeland Security components support the nation by sustaining a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks, as well as emergency response during national catastrophe.

CG-LIMS supports the USCG Modernization goal of a single, unified logistics system that improves mission-readiness, operational effectiveness, and decision-making by enabling decision support at the enterprise and tactical level. CG-LIMS uses the Mission Support Business Model and the four cornerstones of that model: Configuration Management, Total Asset Visibility, Bi-Level Maintenance, and a single point of accountability through Product Line Managers. It will be the authoritative source for the configuration management of USCG assets, enabling product line management by providing total asset visibility throughout the enterprise. It will be the tool through which all maintenance is managed, and by which the enterprise supply chain is driven. The components of configuration management, maintenance management, supply chain management, and technical information management will be integrated and configured to allow efficient execution of a standardized business process.   Benefits/Stakeholders: CG-LIMS will achieve significant savings in CG's annual operating expenses for assets and increase the time those assets can be at sea and in air by integrating the support processes and capabilities to improve operational effectiveness and reduce total ownership costs for air, surface, vessel and Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information Technology (C4IT) platforms; and is intended to be the enterprise asset management system for the CG.

The program acquires and implements the C4ISR capabilities mandated by the asset ORDs to improve the USCG response to emerging threats within the maritime domain. C4ISR mission needs, threats and gaps described in the 2004 Deepwater Mission Need Statement (MNS) were validated in a 2012 C4ISR MNS and remain valid. C4ISR concerns extend beyond deepwater regions to wherever USCG assets are relied upon to support the services enduring roles of Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship. To effectively respond to the threats facing our maritime region, the program will focuses on the following priorities: Functionality - obtain core C4ISR for air, surface, intelligence and shore; Interoperability - transition from proprietary to government to open solutions; Implementation - net-centric design, initial asset installs, upgrades and back-fits; Supportability - lab infrastructure that supports the Governments role as system integrator and keeps pace with evolving information technology demands and changes; and Sustainment - technology development and upgrades that reduce O&M costs. Funding for this business case only includes Acquisition, Construction & Improvement (AC&I) funds provided by the C4ISR program, which is limited to the design and development of C4ISR systems for USCG assets.

An asset equipped with modern C4ISR equipment will be able to synthesize its own sensor data with data from other sources, such as Coast Guard and partner agency ships, aircraft, and shore commands. This functionality allows Coast Guard units to see, hear, and process what all other friendly assets see, hear, and process, facilitating tactical decisions for operational commanders  both on-scene and from afar. This enhances situational awareness within maritime areas of the United States, specifically focusing on the mitigation of possible threats from terrorists and other criminals, while concurrently observing and assisting legitimate users in American ports, waterways, and coastal regions.

These capabilities have been leveraged and integrated to expand the capabilities to inbound pedestrian, outbound vehicle and pedestrian, and U.S. Border Patrol (BP) checkpoint processing; and improve existing primary processing operations. LBIs goals are to facilitate the flow of travelers into the U.S. in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to Secure and Manage Flows of People and Goods while minimizing disruption and facilitating safe and secure inbound and outbound legal flows of people and goods; increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of land border processing; and integrate data to support intelligence and targeting within the Land Border Triangle: inbound, checkpoint, and outbound. Benefits include: vehicle (20%) and pedestrian (35%) inspection processing faster than standard processing without LBI technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes; reduced manual license plate corrections and fewer time and labor intensive secondary referrals. The reduced number of acceptable documents, and increased document security features make it easier for officers to identify fraudulent documents.  LBI extended benefits from initial inbound vehicle capabilities by ensuring that vehicle and document data can also be acquired when vehicles leave the U.S. (outbound) or travel within the U.S. interior (U.S. Border Patrol checkpoints).  LBI has also extended these benefits to travelers entering the U.S. on foot (pedestrians) and buses. Key LBI customers include CBP officers, U.S. Border Patrol agents, and the traveling public.  LBI stakeholders include CBP officers and agents, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State, Mexico and Canada. The beneficiaries are the traveling public and the governments of Canada, and Mexico and their citizens.  The original LBI  investment allowed CBP to address the requirements imposed by Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), Public Law 108-458), as amended, by June 1, 2009.  LBI capabilities add security and decrease inbound primary processing time, which reduces border wait time.",,"LBI provides technologies and infrastructure to improve border operation facilitation and security.   For inbound vehicle and pedestrian processing, RFID technologies, upgraded LPRs, an improved primary inspection application, direction variable message signage, traffic management devices, and policies like active lane management (ALM) expedite border crossing, more efficiently use scarce officer and infrastructure resources.  For example, the promotion of RFID technology and new RFID document options result in more efficient processing methods: vehicles (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without the RFID technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes.  The improved LPRs have reduced manual plate corrections by 10 million per year further reducing process time and improving security.  The benefits that accrue from the technical facilitation (RFID, LPR, VPC) of the crossing process are far reaching: increased throughput per officer, reduced border crossing wait time, and increased capacity to accommodate increases in border crossing volume.  Increased border crossing volume has a positive impact on the U.S. economy.  These capabilities also provide more enhanced information about travelers which improves border crossing security.  LBI returns are calculated based on the difference in wait time prior to LBI compared to post LBI, and by estimating the value of that time for the traveling public.  The original WHTI Land Regulatory Analysis establish low, medium and high values ($ per hour) for both business and private travelers.  These value factors are multiplied by the net wait time differences to arrive at an estimated total return.","The LBI investment was authorized by Congress to address the requirements imposed by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), Public Law 108-458), as amended.

The 3 phase implementation of SAP was completed in October of 2004. This effort was undertaken as a result of an analysis of legacy Customs Asset Management Processes and replaced numerous legacy financial, procurement, and property systems with a single, fully integrated solution.  The investments goals are to provide managerial and mission support benefits to CBP including: complete integration of business processes within one system, improved financial statement reporting and internal controls, reduced cycle-time, elimination of duplicate data entry, improved data accuracy, single system reporting, and enhanced analytical reporting.  SAP supports QHSR Mission 2; Secure and Manage our Borders.  SAPs benefits and contribution to mission delivery ensures that CBP is in compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems. Additionally SAP provides the financial data, procurement of mission supplies, and asset tracking and reporting which allows front line offices to accomplish their mission.  The SAP approach reduces functional gaps identified in past audits and raises performance to acceptable industry benchmarks.  The SAP Program is in a steady - state mode under the Investment Management Process. CBP is now state-of-the-art and has been identified as a leader in Financial Management by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The SAP system must be maintained and supported so that CBP financial staff can meet their timelines and efficiency targets which help CBP to operate effectively.  Maintaining SAP will also help CBP continue receiving unqualified audit opinions.  The key customers and primary beneficiaries of the system include the over 7,500 CBP field and headquarters role-based users as well as CBP and DHS management who utilize the data and information processed and reported onin SAP. Other stakeholders for the SAP program include the Office of Finance and the Office of Information Technology as co-sponsors of the program; as well as others who rely on accurate financial data from CBP.",,"SAP is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that replaced ten stove-piped, outdated, and underperforming mainframe systems that resulted in audit findings of significant internal control weaknesses and were deemed insufficient and no longer suited to meeting data processing and reporting needs.  SAP adequately addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  
Total cost to support the operations and maintenance of the SAP system are approximately $20M annually.  These costs include government FTE, contractor support, software license agreements, and miscellaneous equipment and training.
As an integrated ERP system, SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting.  The elimination of duplicate entry manual processes in both asset and financial management have created significant cost savings.  The QPAM analysis in 1999 found that implementation of an ERP system would generate the following reductions in government labor related to asset and financial management:  Planning reduced by 38%, Budgeting by 8.6%, Acquisition by 27.4%, Pay and Expend by 50%, and Monitor and Control would be reduced by 46%.  The Strategic and Business/Mission Analysis shows the many benefits SAP provides to CBP/DHS including:  complete integration of business processes within one system; improved financial statement reporting and internal controls; reduced cycle-time; elimination of duplicate entry; improved data accuracy; single system reporting; enhanced analytical reporting; and compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems.
The SAP program reports performance annually via the Operational Analysis (OA) covering the following areas:  Customer Results, Strategic and Business results, Financial Performance, Innovation, Performance Measure Results, and Risk Assessment.  Summary results are reported on the OA tab of this form.  The program reports on five metrics in the INVEST system via the monthly reporting form.  Based on the Office of Finance Customer Satisfaction Surveys in FY2018 the SAP Overall Average Satisfaction Rating remained consistently high at 3.94 out of a possible 5.0 across all survey components.  The Technical Performance Analysis of SAP shows the system planned availability is above 99% for the 2018 fiscal year to date, indicating little to no unplanned downtime for the SAP production server.  The team remains committed to primary stakeholders with Strategic and Business engagement at least once a quarter.  Help desk performance remains high and the level I help desk are on target to meet the 72% resolution rate resulting in a quick resolution for SAP users to their inquiries.  And inquiries of all types to the help desk including phone calls, and emails will be resolved in an average of under 4 hours for the coming fiscal year.
SAP continues to be a good investment for CBP and the federal government and critical in managing CBPs Budget, Revenue, and Asset Management processes.  Most recently published Performance and Accountability Report for FY2016 include $19 billion in budgetary resources, $44 billion in revenue, and $16 billion in assets.    CBP has received an unqualified opinion on stand-alone audits each year since 1996, running on SAP since 2004.","Three recent legislative mandates that have been implemented by the CBP team are as follows: 
The Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) is a project of the DHS Unity of Effort Initiative. This requirement has been met by the standardization of appropriations within SAP, which has increased comparability and transparency and enhanced strategic decision making.  The new CAS was implemented at CBP with the FY17 appropriation.  Additional information on CAS can be found here:  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DMO%20(Departmental%20Management%20and%20Operations)%20-%20OCFO%20-%20A%20Common%20Appropriations%20Structure%20for%20DHS%20-%20FY%202016%20Crosswalk.pdf
 In May 2014, President Obama signed the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) (P.L. 113-101) into law. Now implemented within the SAP system, the DATA Act makes Federal spending data more accessible, searchable, and reliable. It not only makes it easier to understand how the Federal government spends taxpayer dollars but also serves as a tool for better oversight, data-centric decision-making, and innovation both inside and outside of government. This was accomplished by standardization of the short text data field in SAP. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) lead the government-wide implementation of the DATA Act.  The DATA Act project was completed and implemented at CBP in October 2016.  For more information on the DATA Act follow this link:  https://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/data-model/
The third mandate was for the Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID).  To satisfy this requirement the SAP team updated the structure of the contract and PO number in the SAP system which has resulted in each PIID used to identify a solicitation or contract action being unique Government-wide.  This will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of the contract award as required.  This project was completed and implemented at CBP in late FY2017.  Additional information on this mandate can be found in the FARin Subpart 4.16 sections (4.1601, 4.1602, 4.1603) https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/pdf/FAR.pdf.

The detailed analysis included developing Life Cycle Cost Estimates (LCCEs) for the three viable communication alternatives to compare to the Status Quo/Legacy Land Mobile Radio System (LMR) to conduct a financial analysis; 1) Conventional Vote Scan 2) Trunked, and 3) Simulcast. The financial analysis included ROI, Net Present Value, and Payback Period for each alternative using the Status Quo/Legacy LMR System as the baseline. Tools used to support analysis were Crystal Ball (for Monte Carlo simulations), the Automated Cost Estimating Integrated Tools Cost Estimating Relationship Library Tool, and MS Excel. The preferred alternative was, and remains, the conventional vote scan system because it possessed the lowest primary cost attribute in acquisition, and secondly, has the highest return on investment (ROI) and the lowest payback period. Cost avoidance and savings are applied through efficient acquisition processes to include more efficient LMR maintenance agreements, and the implementation of advanced technology communication equipment, where possible, that provides lower long-term maintenance cost. The LMR system and communications capabilities are critical to U.S. border protection and ensuring CBP law enforcement safety and security, and though advanced technology affords maintenance savings, that technology is increasing in cost. TACCOM ROI is best described in qualitative terms through improved reliability, performance and other and benefits provided. The current and future government benefits are: 1) Improved communication capability for border protection and agent safety; 2) Improved operational availability (>90%)/reliability/maintainability (refreshing/updating obsolete equipment); 3) Increased system coverage (innovative technology/increased remote communications capabilities/more RF tower locations); 4) Increased network capacity (improved compliance with NTIA narrowband mandate, provides foundation for future data/video capability); 5) Increased security (advanced Encryption Standard (AES)); 6) Improved situational awareness (faster incident response); 7) Better interoperability (implementation of P25 standard enabling multi-agency communication capabilities). Externally, these benefits provide same-technology-level tactical communications between government law enforcement/emergency management and external partners, as many external partners currently employ (or plan to) modernized communication capabilities. This leads to faster incident/emergency response times that enable efficient dissemination of information to external government organizations, improved coordination between federal, state/province and local public safety agencies, increased government transparency and accountability. Externally, these benefits provide the ultimate benefit to U.S. citizens through increased citizen safety/border protection.","The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act earmarked $60M for the modernization of Tactical Communications equipment at CBP. In addition, $10M in Border Security supplemental funds were dedicated to CBP Tactical Communications - http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/recovery/CBP_Tactical_Communications_Modernization_Program_2009-05-15.pdf. TACCOM directly supports and continues to adhere to basic homeland security mission Secure and Manage Our Borders as revised in the 2014 QHSR. CBP is responsible for securing the nations borders against illegal entry of people and goods while facilitating legitimate travel and trade. To support this mission, CBP operates and maintains one of the largest Land Mobile Radio (LMR) tactical voice communications infrastructures in the Federal government. Tactical communications capabilities are essential to coordinating mission activities and protecting the safety of over 46,000 CBP law enforcement agents and officers. Agents and officers operate in remote areas where their radio is often their only communications channel to coordinate activities or summon assistance.

ATS is a web-based enforcement and decision support tool that uses intelligence info and technology to target suspect inbound and outbound shipments for exams and passengers for inspection. ATS allows CBP officers to focus their efforts on cargo shipments and passengers consistent with current threats. ATS standardizes names, addresses, ship names, and similar data so these data elements can be more easily associated with other business data to form a more complete picture of passengers, imports and/or exports in context with previous behavior of the parties involved. Every passenger and shipment processed through ATS is subject to a real-time risk evaluation. Risk assessment strategies are multi-tiered in their approach and are founded on complex statistical studies, data analyses, and rules based on knowledge engineering. ATS goals are to serve the DHS Mission of Secure and Manage our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public. ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts continue to provide significant benefit to the public. ATS provides selectivity and target capability to support CBP inspection and enforcement activities. As volumes of data increase in people, cargo, and conveyances, officers require increasingly efficient access to more relevant real-time info on which to base critical admission decisions.  The ATS systems address data quality improvements to ensure efforts are focused on only those persons and cargo that present most probable threats to the homeland.  The beneficiaries and key customers of ATS are: CBP Officers and Analysts, the CBP National Targeting Center, CBP Office of Field Operations, CBP Office of International Trade, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Transportation Security Administration, and theUnited States Public. Stakeholders include: DHS/CBP (OFO and OIT). ATS utilizes information received from TECS, APIS, and other systems identified in the Enterprise Architecture tab. ATS analyzes over 17M transactions per day for potential threats.  Total ATS passengers and cargo systems maintain 99% uptimes.  Additionally, ATS scans over 150 million Air, Ocean, Rail, Truck, and Auto shipments for potential threats.",,"The ROI cannot be calculated because the AoA/AA was not required when the ATS-M investment was developed and deployed.  However, ATS continues to provide a significant ROI by streamlining the processing of passengers and cargo while increasing the likelihood of identifying threats to the Homeland (e.g., narcotics or weapons). ATS has been operational since 2005. ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by providing risk data on passengers and cargo. Hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and passengers provide officers and agents valuable info for a potential action. This is an invaluable resource capability. ATS also continues to provide quality data by working with other government agencies to eliminate derogatory matches and potential threats that are deemed false positives. ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characteristics provide information that assists in better targeting efforts. 
 Another benefit from ATS is that users receive critical information from hotlists produced on individuals and cargo that present targeted threats to the homeland.  In some instances, via Visa Pre-Adjudication, passengers are vetted and denied visas prior to attempting to board an aircraft.  This reduces the workload for TSA screeners by reducing the number of potential threats screened because they are previously vetted.  This again saves critical time and money and provides a significant value to the security of our nation.
 ATS provides significant benefits through various applications and models. One example is the Air Express Intellectual Property Rights model within ATS which has captured over $188M of goods in FY17. From October 2017- June 2018 over 601,000,000 shipments were scored for targeting purposes. This far exceeded the FY target goal.  These are only a few examples of the multiple models in production within ATS.     ATS serves DHS Mission of Securing and Managing our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a significant benefit to the public. ATS helps secure lawful trade and travel which is vital for national security and public safety.  Governmentally, ATS utilizes system engineering techniques to maintain a system of systems capability throughout its components. ATS provides stakeholders valuable information to target and capture potential threats. ATS is used as a source system to target threats and provide the useful information to boots on the ground teams that can then make an informed decision on a passenger or cargo event. Users receive critical information from hotlists produced on individuals and cargo that present targeted threats to the homeland.  The 0.00 value in the table below is per DHS guidance as ATS does not have an AoA, which would contain the ROI.","ATS aligns with the QHSR goals: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security and Secure and Manage Our Borders.  ATS provides critical targeting capabilities that allow targeters in the field to evaluate threats at a much faster rate and interdict when applicable.  This provides additional security and prevention of potential terrorist activity at the border and ports of entry.  ATSs predictive models deliver machine learning and faster analysis of critical intelligence information.  Additionally, passenger and cargo targeting efforts have been augmented with several name matching algorithms that reduce the number of false positives. This also reduces the amount of time for vetting thus saving analysts time and allowing them to focus efforts on more critical threats.  This helps to better secure the US borders.

ACE delivers these capabilities in a secure, paper-free, web environment. ACE has fulfilled Executive Order 13659, which mandated the creation of a Single Window. ACE is the system through which the Single Window is realized. ACE is the primary means by which agencies with trade-related responsibilities will receive from users the standard set of data and other relevant documentation required for the release of imported cargo and the clearance of cargo for export. These capabilities/mandates align to the DHS mission of Securing and Managing our Borders. 
A key goal of ACE is to modernize functionality from two legacy systems, the Automated Commercial System (ACS) and the Automated Export System (AES). AES has already been successfully retired and its functionality subsumed by ACE in 2014. ACE has modernized all capabilities from ACS except for Collections which will be modernized once funding has been identified. 
ACE provides considerable benefits to its stakeholders. This includes the enhanced targeting of high-risk shipments and automation, enabling CBP to process cargo faster. Another benefit includes the ability for CBP to focus on border security tasks and inter-agency information sharing, resulting in a more efficient workflow and reduction in the cost of labor and paper intensive activities which are expensive. ACE enables the Government and the private sector to increase reporting accuracy and compliance with U.S. laws, promoting efficiency in Government and improved public service. 
ACEs key stakeholders, customers and beneficiaries are CBP, Partner Government Agencies (PGAs), and the Trade community. CBP includes border and trade enforcement personnel who use ACE to process shipments arriving into the U.S. PGAs include 47 government agencies that have statutory relationships with CBP or the authority of cargo and/or a conveyance in an import or export transaction. Trade includes commercial entities that import/export and provide brokerage services to those importing/exporting goods into and out of the US.",,"The following is the explanation on ROI (47%) as stated in the attached AoA document: 
 
The Return On Investment (ROI) indicates the percent saved in future O&M dollars for every dollar spent on the initial investment. ROI is based on O&M savings in the following areas:  
     Help desk support -Application, hardware and software maintenance 
     Data center labor 
     User Training and Materials 
     Security Testing  
     Operational analyses due to lower usage of the mainframe platform  
     Efficiencies from the CBP target architecture from getting off the mainframe 
     Reduced licensing costs  
     Shared system components  
     Standardizing certification and accreditation  
     Improving scalability and reliability and instituting open standards.  
The benefits of modernizing to a more efficient electronic interface will enhance communications between CBP, PGAs, and the Trade Community. The improved communications will provide time savings for entry corrections and allow for more timely cargo processing. For example, the Document Imaging System (DIS) will enable paper forms to be received and processed electronically, providing more efficiency at the Port of Entry (POE) and saving time and money for the government and the Trade Community. Ultimately the new functionality will free up more time for port personnel to perform mission work rather than clerical and administrative tasks. ACE's performance metrics map and measure planned cost savings and efficiency improvements that are noted in the Operational Performance section of this document.
ACE will save $36.6M annually by decommissioning the legacy mainframe, once Collections functionality is completed. Currently Collections is an unfunded, and deferred requirement. The program is seeking funds to complete the development of Collections in ACE and retiring the mainframe.
ACE reducescost by providing CBP personnelwith information to better target their compliance and enforcement efforts, increase overall operational effectiveness and by creating one system that provides a single window for CBP to interact, manage, and oversee the import/export data, and enforcement systems to provide end-to-end visibility of the entire trade cycle. The result is a force multiplication effect for CBP and PGAs that provides officers import processing and tracking, allowing more time and resources to target compliance, enforcement, and national security activities.   
Below are examples of benefits of the ACE system:
-ACE is reliable, it has an availability of 99.37% over the last 365 days. (ACE metric and KPP)
-ACE provides 99.999% of all data required to ATS for targeting and selectivity. (ACE metric and KPP) 
-Savings to CBP due to reduced Primary Processing Time (PPT) thus far in FY18: $5.64M 
-Savings to Trade due to Periodic Monthly Statements and Interest thus far in FY18: $108.405M 
-Savings to CBP Periodic Monthly Statement thus far in FY18: $5.59M.
Below are details from the latest report of ACE Program Metrics on the Operational Effectiveness of the ACE Program:
- 61,034 ACE Trade accounts have been created to date. This represents a 13% increase from last year.
- Average national truck primary processing time is 54.13 seconds for May 2018, which is 42.2 % improvement over the 93.7 second ACS baseline, and is lower than the May 2017 processing time which was 54.92 seconds.","Requirements for this investment include: 
 
1) The delivery of ACE capabilities fulfills the Customs Modernization Act of 1993 by enabling CBP personnel and trade community users to electronically submit and retrieve trade data. ACE is providing CBP personnel with enhanced automated tools and information to perform security and compliance targeting to decide which cargo poses a potential risk, and what cargo should be expedited because it complies with U.S. laws. SAFE Port Act of 2006 - directed that all agencies requiring documentation for clearing or licensing the importation and exportation of cargo participate in an interagency initiative to establish a single portal system known as the International Trade Data System. ACE is intended to facilitate the collection and distribution of standard electronic import and export data required by all Federal agencies.

The final deployment of ACE, originally scheduled for January 14, 2017, was delayed due to the discovery of previously unidentified Collections requirements. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) conducted a business case analysis for Collections, resulting in a determination to continue Collections in the ACE program as a project with deferred requirements.
Since the completion of the business case analysis, CBP has identified limited funding for ACE Collections and Collections was granted an Acquisition Decision Event (ADE)-2B for Release 1 on February 25, 2019.

It is used to review air, sea, train, and limited bus passengers and crew in an effort to identify possible terrorists, uncover high-risk individuals, and facilitate the clearance process for legitimate travelers. 
 
The goal of APIS is to facilitate clearance of valid travelers, who are not appearing on watch lists. Commercial/private carriers and aircraft provide APIS information from the biographic information found in the travel documents before traveler boarding of commercial/private vessels and aircraft. The information is then transmitted to CBP prior to departure. It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. 
 
Current benefits of APIS include matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance. APIS currently collects inbound and outbound data for air and sea passengers; converts to World Customs Organization standards to transmit and acquire data; processes Canadian and Mexican APIS data for passengers traveling from overseas. Electronic APIS (eAPIS) and Electronic Notice of Arrival/Departure (eNOA/D) are web-based functions that allow air carriers and vessels operating without advance departure control systems to transmit data electronically to CBP. Small/medium air carriers can upload data to CBP, acknowledge receipt of data to carriers, and allow carriers to view and request performance reports.
 
APIS supports mission delivery by screening the information against law enforcement databases containing lookout records from many agencies and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify travelers who are a threat tonational security and should not be allowed to travel, and target travelers who need additional inspection upon arrival at a Port of Entry (POE). 
 
Key Customers include CBP Office of Field Operations, Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Department of State (DoS) and Airlines, domestic terminals and U.S. Ports of Entry.
Stakeholders include CBP Office of Field Operations, CBP, TSA and DoS. 
Beneficiaries include the airlines, domestic terminals, U.S. POEs, Mexico and Canada.",,"The APIS Program has been in sustainment since 2002.  The program is not required to complete a Cost Benefit Analysis.  APIS was granted a waiver from Under Secretary for Management Mr. Raphael Boras in 2013 (ADM attached in documents).
APIS improves CBP's efficiency to obtain advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  APIS is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. Benefits provided by APIS to both internal and external to the government cannot be easily quantified. In terms of internal benefits, APIS has proven to be exceptionally valuable and useful.  It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. APIS data is critical to CBP biographical entry/exit systems.  APIS is the single best method by which CBP obtains advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  The apprehension of the Times Square Bomber is the most visible recent example in that APIS alerted CBP that the bomber was attempting to flee the country and where he could be apprehended.
The computerized analysis of inbound and outbound passengers dramatically increases the efficiency of analysis of high risk traveler identification, as well as, facilitation of low risk passenger traffic. Within the APIS, the development of the eAPIS automated report generation module has significantly reduced the time Account Managers spend on processing APIS sufficiency reports. Several of the APIS KPPs shows how APIS has reduced the time and increased accuracy to process all APIS Queries. For example, APIS KPP 73687 - Decrease the average APIS Land VPC Respond Time, has reduced the average processing respond time from 5.5 seconds down to 1.0 seconds in the last two years. Faster responding time has increased the efficiency of how CBP process vehicle primary client significantly. It is especially important when our Nation is under evolving terrorist threats.","APIS fulfilled the mission needs outlined in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, The Acts require commercial air and sea carriers to electronically transmit arrival and departure manifests for each commercial vessel or aircraft prior to arrival at or departure from the US. This includes matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance. APIS supports mission delivery by screening the information against law enforcement databases containing lookout records from many agencies and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify travelers who are a threat to national security and should not be allowed to travel, and target travelers who need additional inspection upon arrival at a Port of Entry.

APIS is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various Watch Lists.
APISs aligns to the QHSR (Quadrennial Homeland Security Review) 2.1 goal to Secure US Air, Land and Sea Boarders and Approaches. APIS meets this requirement by reviewing passengers and crew to identify possible terrorists or other high-risk individuals. This helps identify threats versus non threats. Commercial/private carriers and aircraft provide APIS information from the biographic information found in the travel documents before traveler boarding of commercial/private vessels and aircraft.

The current business processes cannot adequately prevent backlog buildups resulting from application surges after statutory/regulatory changes or special events. The ability to quickly adapt to future events will help USCIS to become a more efficient and effective organization and position itself to avoid repeating the backlog cycle.
 
Since the time of legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Agencys operations have been heavily paper?based. USCIS business processes revolve around paper forms for nearly all benefit types. To streamline their processes, individual field offices had often sought to acquire their own technology and develop innovative procedures. Procedural inconsistencies can undermine decisional integrity and reduce the ease with which applicants and petitioners conduct business with USCIS. USCIS recognized that reliance on paper files in the modern transaction environment has affected efficiencies related to processing immigration benefits, verifying applicants identity, and providing DHS and other government agencies with the information they need to make informed business decisions. These inconsistencies need to be addressed to align with the USCIS Strategic Goals of identifying, addressing, and mitigating national security and fraud risks, delivering high quality services, and enabling the USCIS workforce to excel. The USCIS Transformation Program was initiated in Fiscal Year 2006 to transform USCISs benefit processing operations, in part by creating the centralized, web?based IT solution ELIS.
 
The key customers, stakeholders, and beneficiaries ELIS are: enterprise partners; Department of Homeland Security components; USCIS employees; customers and advocates (the persons petitioning USCIS for benefits and services and the organizations representing those individuals), stakeholders with oversight and review responsibilities including Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, the Government Accountability Office, and the DHS Office of the Inspector General; and other stakeholders including public IT industry groups, U.S. citizens, and media outlets.",,"Transformations estimated cost avoidances fall into five categories:  avoidances from reduced mailings (FY12-33), decommissioning of legacy systems (FY18-20), reduced data entry (FY12-33), reduced call center calls (FY12-33) and reduced file movement and storage (FY12-33).
Therefore, the Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated by determining the net benefit, which in this case is the total cumulative cost avoidances for reduced mailings, systems decommissioning, reduced data entry, call center calls, and file movement and storage over the lifecycle of the system (FY12-33), dividing the net benefit by the total initial capital investment, subtracting 1, and converting the remaining figure to a percentage.
A negative 42% ROI indicates that this investment will recover some of its initial purchase and implementation of new capital assets to create a new capability.  However, this ROI calculation is in the early phases of this investments development and does not fully quantify the additional internal and external benefits that have not yet been assessed.

The goals of the Program are to procure, deploy and maintain Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) technology, at and between Ports of Entry, to enable CBPs border security mission without impacting legitimate trade and traffic. Current priorities of the program are to maintain or improve NII examination rates across vectors, while offering efficiencies and increased ability for officers to identify anomalies in conveyances.  To do this, current projects are focused on identifying solutions which address four primary capability gaps: (1) aging technology, (2) stand-alone technology, (3) data-networking and integration, and (4) lack of radiation scanning in the rail environment. 
  
In FY17, CBP conducted approximately 6.5 million NII examinations, which resulted in more than 2475 seizures weighing 359,000lbs and $3.9 million. These systems are force multipliers, with tremendous economic impact. The average NII system examination of a cargo container takes approximately 8 minutes, while a manual inspection takes, on average, 2 hours. This approach expedites trade without sacrificing security, while also minimizing costs. CBP estimates that NII technology provides an annual workforce saving/avoidance of approximately 7,000+ additional CBP officers. Key customers of the Program are CBP Field Offices and the CBP frontline officers and Border Patrol agents who operate the NII technologies. Key stakeholders of the Program include Congressional Committees with a focus on, but not limited to, Homeland/Transportation/Border/Maritime Security and Appropriations; OMB; DHS - Science & Technology (S&T), U.S. Coast Guard, and CBP; General Services Administration; Trade Community; Port Authorities and Terminal Operators; and original equipment manufacturers and service support providers of NII technologies. Other beneficiaries include U.S. citizens; individuals traveling to the U.S.; R&D communities seeking to advance imaging and detection capabilities; and international communities with similar inspection and detection technology or operations.",,"The calculated ROI for the NII program shows a net return of 123.4% based on a net present value (NPV) analysis in the initial Analysis of Alternatives.  Since that analysis, the NII Program has reached ADE-3 and is procuring and deploying the technology as planned.  The performance of the deployed NII technology supports the previously estimated ROI, and is achieving the projected benefits (internal and external; and quantitative and qualitative benefits). Continued benefits and the ROI have been validated through new technology specifications (throughput, accuracy, reliability, etc.) and acceptance tests of those specifications for new and replacement technology.  Actual performance in the field has validated the operational capabilities of the technology upon which the initial benefits were estimated and the ROI calculated. A new ROI has not been calculated but the reasonableness of the initial estimate is confirmed because the program costs are near the LCCE and the quantitative benefits of technology capabilities are as estimated.  The qualitative benefits, including those to commercial trade, are supported by the timeliness of inspections and the results of the 2016 and 2017 calendar year Operational Analyses.
  
The NII Program provides internal and external benefits that are quantified and used to calculate the ROI.  Internally, NII systems reduce the time to conduct a manual exam by over 93 percent; an NII exam takes 8 minutes and a manual exam takes 120 minutes. To quantify this reduction: over 20 million vessel and truck containers with a market value of about $1.5 trillion annually enter the United States at and between Ports Of Entry (POE). Of these containers, NII large-scale technology is used to inspect approximately 10 percent of the targeted vessel and truck containers (about 2 million containers). Without using NII technology, the same number of exams would take an additional 3.8 million man-hours or approximately 7,000 additional CBP officers. NII systems also provide operational benefits spanning personnel safety, speed, and accuracy of detection. 
  
From an external perspective, the expedited inspection process - made possible with NII technologies - saves the trade industry an estimated 0.5-percent to 1.5-percent increase to the cost of goods that would be created if manual inspections were performed. This is cost avoidance to the trade industry of approximately $5.8 billion to $17.5 billion per year. This cost is based on a parametric estimate using current literature on the cost of transit time for the delivery of goods. While NII technology offers exceptional deterrence benefits at and between the Nations POEs, the greatest qualitative external benefit of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism. Through the use of NII equipment CBP has increased the number of and the quality of cargo inspections which decreases the probability that Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) or other instruments of terrorism will enter the U.S.","The Program will provide efficient and effective technological capabilities to interdict and detect illegal weapons, contraband and people arriving at the U.S. borders without affecting trade or travel.

The program initiated in the 1990s and was incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acquisition portfolio in January 2016 through achievement of Acquisition Decision Event 3 (ADE-3).
Since the achievement of ADE-3, the program has utilized resources to significantly buy-down the age of the fleet. The program has procured 40 large scale systems in addition to the 326 already deployed, resulting in exceedance of the Final Operating Capability (FOC) quantity of 342 identified in the Acquisition Program Baseline (APB). The increase in legacy capacity is needed to expand coverage in Personally Operated Vehicle (POV) lanes based upon seizure statistics and to address the opioid threat.
It is anticipated that the 342nd system will be deployed in FY 2020, prior to the APB FOC milestone of FY 2024. These procurements have been made while staying within APB cost parameters. CBP is also in the process of assessing future requirements for a follow-on program, including the completion of a NII Capabilities Analysis Report (CAR) validated March 16, 2017, and NII Mission Needs Statement (MNS) approved August 14, 2018. The MNS states that as trade and threat trends have evolved, current NII operational capabilities present limitations across CBPs dynamic operating environments.
The program is generating a Capability Development Plan (CDP) and Rough Order of Magnitude cost estimate to support an ADE-1 in the Q3 FY19. In the interim, the program is coordinating with Science and Technology on numerous pilots to evaluate technologies and concepts of operation to increase efficiency and address gaps. Technology demonstration plans are in progress, to cohesively document technology demonstrator selection, purpose and objectives, approach for test and evaluation, success criteria, synergy between pilots, efficacy of the pilots to future program decisions, and life cycle sustainment or disposition.

This FSM initiative is Department-wide and consists of multiple Component-level FSM initiatives. The FSM Trio program continues the FSM initiative for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD, formerly DNDO), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and United States Coast Guards (USCG). The goal of the FSM Trio program is to obtain Financial System Modernization Solution (FSMS) with fully integrated financial, procurement, and asset management functions to improve operational performance, reduce and/or eliminate material weaknesses, implement standardized business processes, improve financial operations, enforce data integrity, provide financial transparency, and a single solution of cradle-to-grave contracting for all acquisitions, and ensure compliance with federal laws, regulations, guidelines, and requirements. This will replace the Core Accounting System (CAS) functionality, which is now used by the Trio. A modernized financial system delivers a holistic, enterprise-level view of how resources are allocated and spent. Additional benefits include: Replacement of outdated technology; Improvement in audit outcomes and data visibility by enabling financial reporting consistency and eliminating material weaknesses/deficiencies; Enhancement of system performance; Leverage of efficiencies & economies of scale; Optimization of interoperability with improved user interface for accuracy and efficiency; Standardization of business processes and data; Business intelligence and reporting enhancements; Reduction in security vulnerabilities.

Key Beneficiaries: Landowners in Arizona and the citizens of the United States of America.",,"Compared to the baseline operating costs from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the operating costs for IFT system are estimated to be considerably lower ($358.3M vs. $2,104.1M). ROI was calculated by (Operating Costs without IFT - Operating Costs with IFT) divided by the Capital Investment costs, providing the same level of surveillance. Ergo, the key benefit is that for a lower overall operating cost, the IFT system will provide the Border Patrol with a persistent surveillance capability, which will enable them to detect, identify, and track IoIs, thus enabling them to monitor an Area of Interest more efficiently and effectively. Other benefits include: it facilitates mission accomplishment; it allows agents to be realigned since it acts as a force multiplier; agents will be safer since fewer will be needed in the field for surveillance; it will be used only in areas in which it performs well; and it provides improved data (e.g., recorded video) for successful law enforcement accomplishment versus the baseline. The ROI was updated and validated in Oct. 11, 2016 to account for recent program changes.","There are no legislative mandates, outstanding audit findings/material weakness, or Presidential Directive related to this investment.",no,no,yes,,,Jeffrey L.

The program has completed all five of the conditions. CBP submitted a breach notification on 12/15/ 2017, and PARM directed them to provide more information regarding the remediation plan. The root cause of the breach was not completing the passage of a resolution to allow construction of the Tohono Oodham Nation (TON) AoR. CBP submitted a memo on March 15, 2018 to revert the breach declaration as the IFT program deployment situation changed and the anticipated funding shortfall and schedule delay no longer exists.
The Tohono Oodham Nation (location of two planned deployments) expressed their willingness to allow deployment within the Nation, but reduced the overall number of IFT sites from 15 to 10. Please note that CBP has been in real estate negotiations with the Nation for the past 10 years and very close to securing the agreement. Reductions of number of towers renders the program affordable and able to complete FOC. The Tucson Sector reviewed and analyzed the impact of reducing the number of towers and found the reduction acceptable. The towers are not on the international border and USBP agreed to add two IFT camera suites to two communication towers in Ajo-1 to further reduce impacts. The USM granted approval to close the breach notification on 7/1/2018. CBP is still in discussion with TON regarding land ownership/deployment of IFTs with no closure date determined; therefore, a decision was made to remove the TON scope from the program baseline to prevent a future breach event.

Goal: Provide upgraded camera suites with additional surveillance tools, replace the current analog system with a digital system necessary for Certification & Accreditation, and provide modern command and control (C2) facilities to incorporate additional situational awareness capabilities.
Current and Anticipated Benefits: To increase persistence surveillance capabilities through a more secure digital system, improved video quality for C2 operations, and improved detection and situational awareness along wider land border areas.
Mission Delivery Contribution: The RVSS Upgrade Program supports the DHS Strategic Goal 2.1: Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and CBP Strategic Goal 2: Advance Comprehensive Border Security and Management. This includes preventing the illegal entry of people, weapons, dangerous goods, and contraband, and protecting against cross-border threats to health, food, environment, and agriculture, while facilitating the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce, as well as preventing the illegal export of weapons, proceeds of crime, and other dangerous goods. The program will enhance the mission through early detection of border incursions, enhanced identification and classification of the threat, and the ability to track items of interest through a law enforcement resolution. The program will enhance agent and public safety through persistent surveillance in high enforcement areas.
Stakeholders: Internal Stakeholders include Office of Acquisition (OA), Office of Information and Technology (OIT), Office of Border Patrol (OBP), Office of Finance (OF). External stakeholders include US Department of Interior (DOI); National Park Services (NPS); US Fish and Wild Services (USFWS); US Department of Agriculture (USDA)/US Forest Service; private and public landowners and various other regulatory agencies.
Customers and Other Beneficiaries: CBP US Border Patrol Agents, Intelligence Research Specialists, Sector Enforcement Specialists, Supervisors and Joint Field Command and the Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison (OIIL). External Customers and beneficiaries include State and Local law enforcement; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); and the general public.",,"The calculated Return on Investment (ROI) is 669%. Compared to the baseline operating costs of $3,634M with the new operating cost of $562M from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the RVSS operating costs are estimated to be considerably lower. ROI calculation: [(Baseline Operating Costs {with agents only} minus RVSS Upgrade Operating Costs) divided by the Capital Investment Cost], minus 1 providing the same level of surveillance. 
The key internal benefit is that for a lower overall operating cost, the investment will provide the USBP with a persistent surveillance capability, which will enable them to detect, identify, and track Items of Interests (IoIs), thus enabling them to monitor an Area of Interest more efficiently and effectively. Other benefits include: facilitate mission accomplishments; allow agents to be re-aligned since it acts as a force multiplier; agents will be safer since fewer will be required in the field for surveillance; technology will be used only in areas in which it performs well; and improved data will be available (recorded video imagery) for successful law enforcement accomplishment versus the baseline. 
Additional benefits include maintaining low logistics support costs, a minimal number of trouble tickets, a high operational availability, a low number of priority 1 downtime events, and a low number of priority 2 and 3 corrective actions. 
External Benefits: The program could result in indirect and long-term beneficial impacts by reducing the adverse impacts of illegal cross-border violator activities in the project area. The RVSS towers would enhance CBPs detection and threat classification capabilities and increase the efficiency of operational activities within the area of tower coverage. Over time the enhancement of detection capabilities and an increase in operational efficiency could increase the deterrence of illegal cross-border violator activity within the area of tower coverage. 
Planned Outcomes: The intended mission outcomes are three-fold (1) Increase situational awareness provided on the Southwest Border while leveraging the added range potential of cameras systems where practical. (2) Replace the current analog system with a more secure digital system. (3) The RVSS Upgrade is expected to enhance the current mission through early detection of border incursions, through enhanced identification and classification of the threat, and through an improved ability to track items of interest.","Outstanding Audit Finding or Material Weakness: GAO reported in March 2014 and April 2015 that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), had made progress in deploying programs under the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan (the Plan), but could take additional actions to strengthen its management of the Plan and its related programs. Specifically, in March 2014 GAO reported that CBP's schedules and life-cycle cost estimates for the Plan and its three highest-cost programswhich represented 97 percent of the Plan's total estimated costmet some but not all best practices. GAO recommended that CBP ensure that its schedules and cost estimates more fully address best practices, such as validating cost estimates with independent estimates, and DHS concurred. CBP has completed deployment of technology for each of the three highest-cost programs under the Plan, and reported updating some program schedules and cost estimates (Link: http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-671T).",no,no,yes,,,Michael B.

The program scope was expanded to include Rio Grande Valley Section and remaining six CBP Southwest Border Sectors. The RVSS program was also approved to continue moving forward on the RVSS deployment in stations in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. The Arizona Sector (Yuma and Tucson) achieved FOC in Q1 FY 2017 and the system availability is consistently above the 90 percent threshold. RVSS is included in a memo dated October 2016 tasking CBP with completing a MNS, CAR, and CONOPS to address land domain threats. The program has been working to update the documentation with some being completed. CAD approved unconstrained estimate in late 2017 but required an affordability analysis to compare Program of Record to current funding. Affordability analysis provided eliminated PCI shortfalls by funding only the Arizona and RGV sectors but significant shortfalls now exist in OS across the FYHSP due to the new requirement to support Legacy RVSS systems within the current funding, which was not increased in the FY18 budget. In addition, program carried over was less than anticipated between PCI and OS, spending more than planned. There were funds committed in Q3 for which obligations should have been completed, but were delayed in contracts. These items will be awarded in July. Additionally, funds were originally planned to be spent in May for the remainder six AORs in RGV C2 and Station Towers. Construction has not started, but once construction begins, RVSS may see potential savings of up to 60% due to efficiencies achieved from the vendor selection. RVSS is in the process of finalizing the amount of funding that will be used to overhaul the Legacy RVSS. Funds for this effort will be obligated in Q4. Overall contractor performance is acceptable. Increased communication, planning, and coordination between the parties has helped. The contractor is currently implementing a corrective action plan and Ao is now meeting threshold requirements. CDRL quality has improved, with room for improvement. Operational testing was completed within CBP for the current RVSS program (Level 3). Per guidance within the October 2017 LCCE approval memo, the program recently submitted an APB and AA for a scope of work including O&S in the Tucson/Yuma regions and Investment in the RGV.

 The goal of PIVOT is to process flood insurance policies and claims for 5.3 million property owners, to reduce the impact of flooding on private and public structures, and to drive community recovery after disasters. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) supports establishment of operating policies, designation of eligible communities, creation of auditing specifications, experience determination, rate setting, responsibility for the management, operation, maintenance and quality assurance of the systems and data, marketing, training provision, analysis and reporting to Congress, and provision of financial information to all applicable departments and agencies.  
  
 The NFIP is a congressionally mandated program. PIVOT will supports the following DHS and FEMA missions and strategic goals: DHS Mission 5 (Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience), Strategic Goal 1 (Build a Culture of Preparedness), Objective 1.1 (Incentive investments that reduce risk) and Objective 1.2 (Close the Insurance Gap), and FEMA Strategic Goal 2 (Ready the Nation for Catastrophic Disasters). The key benefit of this investment is the continued operation of the NFIP and implementation of legislative reforms from Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 and the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014.   
  
 The NFIP has a stakeholder community consisting of actors within and external to government, due to its unique operating model. NFIP resides within the Federal Insurance & Mitigation Association (FIMA) and interacts with other FEMA risk analysis and risk reduction initiatives. NFIP governs industry program administrators such as the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA), Write Your Own insurance companies (WYOs), FloodInsurance Processing Services Providers to WYOs (Vendors), and adjusters. The customers and beneficiaries are US citizens that are supported by flood insurance policies.
The platform and infrastructure of this investment is cloud-based.

As a part of the AoA, an ROI was calculated over a 10-year period based on forecasted costs. For the selected alternative, the expected 10-year ROI was 204%. The Hybrid Approach was chosen in the AoA and is expected to deliver the largest benefits because it has the highest overall score by a large margin, demonstrating low cost while simultaneously meeting most of the NFIPs business needs and minimizing risks. Because the COTS solutions within the Hybrid Approach are best of breed solutions, they also tend to have larger federal implementations and are compliant with most applicable federal security standards.  Most importantly, Hybrid Approach has a high level of strategic alignment with both the benefits and desired outcomes by this program.","URLs could not be formatted in this box (please see DHS supporting comments for URLs).

The IT systems, services and equipment that compose BPES were formerly managed and implemented in smaller, discrete non-major programs, making it difficult to implement and deliver mission capability and plan for future development and modernization. In FY15, these programs were consolidated into BPES because of their direct support to the USBP mission and because of their technical and functional relationships. BPES objective is to help meet the DHS, CBP, and USBP mission of protecting the U.S. from various 21st century threats and adversaries by enabling capabilities that address challenges in data management, threat response, and resource support through the use of technologies. Current benefits of BPES: 1) Improved Information Sharing and Managementenables the automatic collection, dissemination and analysis of critical asset and personnel data, improving USBPs situational awareness and the identification of resources to improve border enforcement and security through resource prioritization. 2) Improved System and Process Integrationsupports new innovative approaches to exchange information and integrate USBP technology. These efforts help USBP develop efficient day-to-day processes for agents, and reduce operational costs by providing timely information across various CBP systems. 3) Rapid Response Abilityenables USBP to gain greater situational awareness, using sensors along the border, to support rapid response to interdict those crossing the border illegally. Key stakeholders/customers/beneficiaries: 1) Internal CBP: USBP, Office of Field Operations (OFO), Office of Acquisition (OA), Air and Marine Operations (AMO), and Office of Intelligence (OI); 2) Within DHS: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Coast Guard (USCG),Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Science and Technology (S&T), Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS); 3) External to DHS: US Department of Justice (DOJ), US Department of Defense (DOD), Department of State (DOS), White House, Congress, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Government Accountability Office (GAO), Inspectors General (IG); 4) External to the federal government: general public, state and local governments, foreign governments (e.g., Canadian and Mexican governments).",,"The primary benefit of BPES is the facilitation and support of border enforcement mission essential tasks for all 22,500 discrete BPES users, mainly USBP Agents. Without BPES, USBP would be unable to perform critical functions to detect, identify, classify and resolve illegal border activity, thus limiting the effectiveness of the USBP mission and endangering national security. For example, some BPES capabilities improve agent efficiency by 100% - meaning these tasks would be virtually impossible without BPES. Based on this alone, benefits of the BPES investment far exceed the total lifecycle cost of $609M.  In addition, USBP, CBP, other DHS Components (e.g., ICE, CIS, USCG, FEMA, S&T), other federal agencies (e.g., DOJ, DOS and DOD), state, local and foreign governments benefit from BPES by having access to shared information that heighten situational awareness and risk-based decision-making. These agencies achieve cost avoidance from not having to build their own systems, eliminating redundant processes, manpower and operational costs while addressing their missions quickly and effectively. BPES captures information on criminal prosecution activities, facilitating court submissions to DOJ. It also provides real-time border surveillance and monitoring of agent activity and officer safety used by law enforcement. BPES provides workforce staffing information and tracks operational metrics linked with DHS, the FBI and ICE. This integration improves decision-making and supports the rapid deployment of USBP resources while reducing operational costs. BPES provides statistical reports that CBP and multiple DHS components (e.g., FEMA, ICE, CIS) use for strategic and tactical decision-making. It enables USBP to provide reliable statistical information in response to White House, Congress, OMB, GAO, IG, IA and other federal agency requirements, including those of the Departments of State and Justice. State governments, such as the State of Texas, and foreign governments, such as the Governments of Canada, Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala also use information. While BPES shares information with other agencies, it also leverages information and technologies developed or used by other agencies. e3 leverages the ICE Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) by pulling related data that reduces data re-entry and expedites data sharing. e3s Biometrics leverages FBIs IAFIS, US-VISITs IDENT and DoDs ABIS biometrics search/enroll interfaces/repositories. Finally, the future modernization of BPES will achieve even greater cost savings and cost avoidance by significantly improving ease of use, integration, and reducing redundancy. The program will conduct a full ROI analysis on the modernization effort in FY2020. The 0.00 value in the table below is per previous DHS guidance as BPES does not have an AoA, which would contain the ROI.","BPES fulfills the requirements of the following laws: 
1) Immigration and Nationality Act (1965) which bases immigration rules to a preference system focused on immigrants' skills and family relationships. BPES supports this act by providing ICE access to databases to ensure legal border entries. http://library.uwb.edu/static/usimmigration/1965_immigration_and_nationality_act.html 
2) Border Protection Agent Pay Reform Act (BPAPRA) (2014) which provides a new method of compensating USBP agents for overtime work. This law affects only USBP agents in CBP.

Rev Mod goals are to: (1) Reduce or eliminate the labor-intensive manual processes of revenue collections, (2) Increase online and electronic payment options, and (3) Provide revenue collections data at the transaction level for improved reporting and analysis.  Rev Mod estimates that full implementation will result in a decrease of up to 75% of the time spent by CBPs uniformed personnel, and 80% by non-uniformed personnel, in revenue collection activities.  In addition to decreasing the resource time spent on revenue collections, CBP plans to consolidate, automate, and streamline documentation and procedures, improve payment options and reporting capabilities, streamline facility inefficiencies and improve the legal framework with the modernized revenue processes.  Of the approximately $45B (21 million transactions) CBP collects in duties, taxes, and fees annually, nearly $1.5B and 4 million individual transactions are processed in the field by CBPOs and support staff. Rev Mod is targeted to allow nearly 180 CBP Officers and 136 non-uniformed CBP personnel to shift the time currently spent on collection activities, trade and travel enforcement and facilitation duties when transactions are moved to electronic platforms. In addition to CBP savings and efficiencies, the trade and travel industries will benefit from Rev Mod's modernized options for transacting business with CBP.  Lastly, there are direct correlations to economic benefit associated with the effort.  According to the USC CREATE study, for each additional CBP Officer the estimated economic impact includes a $2 million increase in Gross Domestic Product meaning that the reallocation of CBPO time to facilitating trade and travel will potentially have a $360 million economic impact.

This allows Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to adjust the location of its surveillance capabilities to keep pace with the ever-changing border threat. MVSS consists of trucks outfitted with electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensing devices that aid United States Border Patrol (USBP) agents in the detection of illegal border crossings. The MVSS is an integrated suite of sensor equipment mounted in the cargo bed of a Government-furnished short and standard bed light duty truck (e.g., Ford F-150), with an operator workstation located inside the truck cab. The MVSS goals are to increase the situational awareness of CBP by detecting, tracking, identifying, and classifying potential Items of Interest (IoIs). These goals support Mission 2 of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR): ""Secure and Manage our Borders."" More specifically, the MVSS program addresses Goal 2.1: ""Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches."" Anticipated benefits of the MVSS include: 1) Detecting, identifying and tracking IoIs at distances of up to 5 miles, which provides greater surveillance coverage then possible with an agent on foot; 2) Enhancing U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) Agent safety by providing advanced warning of the existence of IoIs and the nature of the threat, including whether IoIs are armed; 3) Allowing for greater response coordination among local, state and federal officials; thereby improving the likelihood of a successful law enforcement resolution, as well as increased officer and border communities safety. Key stakeholders include USBP, Office of Field Operations (OFO), Office of Air and Marine (OAM), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Department of Agriculture, Department of Interior, federal/state/local law enforcement, and U.S./Mexican border communities. The key customer and beneficiaries of the MVSSsystem are USBP agents, who currently rely on legacy capabilities such as sign cutting, which place agents at high risk in difficult locations. By detecting/identifying threats from a safe distance, agents are able to determine the time, method, and location of an interdiction. The short to medium-range ability of this technology provides ample time for agents to prepare for threats.",,"The ROI for MVSS is 1,252 percent. A key conclusion of the Analysis of Alternatives is that there is no single technology to answer the question ""what is the best situational awareness technology for the southwest border?"". The answer depends on the specifics of each area, and cueing by one system to initiate tracking by another provides valuable synergies. For example, MVSS is effective for short and medium distance mobile surveillance, whereas the Mobile Surveillance Capability (MSC) solution is more effective for long distance mobile surveillance.  This approach requires a mix of both mobile and fixed alternatives.  MVSS units enable a wider area coverage with fewer resources than the base case scenario. MVSS improves efficiencies through monitoring by providing mobile electro-optical and infrared sensing capabilities that enable Agents to perform their missions. MVSS mobile capabilities are much more efficient than USBP agents on foot or horseback, covering a wider area with fewer resources. This is the preferred solution in certain urban, rural, and remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor with other systems like IFT.  MVSS will be deployed for day or night use when indicators signal that IoIs are approaching an area. Units will also be deployed to augment surveillance systems that have line-of-sight coverage gaps caused by existing infrastructure, terrain (e.g., ravines or washes), or vegetation. MVSS provides mobile surveillance and situational awareness in remote areas over a range of 40 feet to 5 miles from the deployment location, providing agents the ability to respond to threats in varying locations. Other benefits include increased situational awareness of land borders. MVSS will increase material availability of its system to at least 75 percent, enabling Agents to utilize the technology whenever needed. Furthermore, the mean time to repair the units will not exceed 8 hours a month, and the number of corrective maintenance actionswillnot exceed 2 times a month. These performance metrics advance the CBP Goal: Advance Comprehensive Border Security Management and the DHS Goal: to Secure U.S. Air, Land and Sea Borders and Approaches. USBP has greater flexibility in terms of where assets are deployed, based on threats and needs. In addition, Agents are freed to focus on areas with the highest threats, and provided greater lead time to plan effective interdictions. Most importantly, Agent safety is prioritized as they are less likely to work in entrenched, isolated areas or areas with poor visibility, leaving them vulnerable to potentially harmful engagements.  Lastly, MVSS helps minimize vulnerabilities resulting from the human factor. Despite training and experiences, Agents are vulnerable to compromising operational effectiveness due the fatigue and human errors.  In contrast, one or two Agents equipped with the MVSS are able to surveil up to a 5-mile radius, and can respond to illegal activities at a fraction of the time it would take Agents on foot. The MVSS will enable the USBP stations to maintain situational awareness with fewer Agents, e.g. one-man team surveilling a 5 mile radius versus one 1 Agent, per one mile border, thereby reducing overall costs and improving operational effectiveness.","There are no legislative mandates, outstanding audit findings/material weakness, or Presidential Directive related to this investment.",no,no,no,,,Craig Doheny,1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior,26.357,47.308,,,,,,,4,"The MVSS Program consists of vehicles outfitted with sensors, on telescoping masts and operator interface to enable detection, tracking, identification, and classification of illegal incursions in areas that have gaps in coverage from other surveillance systems.

This includes establishing and maintaining a national database of each system or asset that the Secretary determines to be vital and the loss, interruption, incapacity, or destruction of which would have a negative or debilitating effect on the economic security, public health, or safety of the United States, any State, or any local government.
IP Gateway delivers a suite of specialized tools to DHS Components, Federal agencies, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) governments, and owner/operators of our nations critical infrastructure through a modularized system.  These tools aid the collection and protection of our nations critical infrastructure information.  A consistent methodology applied to assessments supports robust analytics, asset-to-asset comparisons, and cross-government sharing of critical infrastructure information.  Textual and geospatial interfaces assist users in understanding the underlying data and improve the ability to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities.  Tools reinforce efforts in threat contingency planning and incident tracking.  The IP Gateway provides data on events such as flooding and power outages in semi-real-time.
The system ties together different aspects of protecting infrastructure into one convenient location; this improves productivity and makes our nation safer.  Life cycle cost reduction continues as IP Gateway consolidates and modularizes existing capabilities into a smaller, more efficient server-side footprint, removing redundancy in IT applications.  The specialized capabilities of IP Gateway are available through a secure, encrypted, controlled-access web interface.",,"Through the facilitation of information sharing in the domain of critical infrastructure (CI), the IP Gateway continues to provide a single source for the Federal government and the CI community. Additionally, it provides capabilities to State, local, tribal and territorial critical infrastructure protection partners (i.e., first responders, homeland security advisors, law enforcement, etc.) that State and local governments would not be capable of providing. The IP Gateway continues to be an economical way of providing secure hosting for multiple applications across multiple Federal entities, such as the Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP), Federal Protective Service (FPS), and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C). The benefits to the government include cost savings in operations and maintenance (O&M), the centralized servicing of the IP Gateway capabilities, and the economies of scale associated with the wholesale procurement of hardware and software.  
The IP Gateway has provided added benefits through the following capabilities that support incident management and steady state risk analysis for critical infrastructure (CI): 
-Making Critical Infrastructure data searchable, accessible and retrievable while still secure 
-Data and report storage capability 
-CI, cyber, and Federal facility risk assessment and analysis capabilities

Also, cross-border tunnels and their eradication has been a Congressional interest item since FY06. The goal of the investment is to close the capability gaps and contribute to DHS mission delivery: Goal 2.1: Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches by reducing the ability of TOC Networks and other criminals to use the subterranean environment to smuggle drugs, money, people (including some with ties to terrorist organizations), and other contraband into the United States. The anticipated benefits to future users will be the ability to effectively: 1) Predict potential tunnel locations; 2) Detect the presence of suspected tunnels and tunneling activity as well as project the trajectory of a discovered tunnel; 3) Confirm a tunnels existence and location through mapping and measurements; and 4) Coordinate a response that facilitates securely sharing information across all stakeholders. The key customers include U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (ICE HSI), who are also the main beneficiaries of this investment.  A full list of stakeholders include the USBP, CBP Office of Intelligence (OI), CBP Tunnel Threat Management Office (TTMO), Border Enforcement Security Task (BEST) Force / Tunnel Task Force (TTF), CBP Office of Administration (OA), Joint HSI-GoM Tunnel Response Team, Department of Defense (DoD) National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), DoD Northern Command (NORTHCOM) / Joint Task Force - North(JTF-N), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Counter Tunnel Operations Working Group (CTOWG), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), State/Local/Tribal Law Enforcement (LE) Agencies, Canadian Authorities, and Mexican Authorities.",,"CBTT is currently in the Analyze/Select phase, and the program is currently developing the AoA, which will be finalized prior to the ADE-2A review planned for December 2018. The Return on Investment (ROI) will be a closing of the capability gaps in the field through the delivery of new capabilities. The investment will benefit internal DHS stakeholders, primarily USBP and ICE HSI, by equipping them to more effectively carry out their mission objectives, including the protection of both their safety and the safety of the American people.  Specifically, CBTT will allow USBP to improve tunnel detection capabilities by efficiently assessing tunnel locations, detecting and projecting tunnel trajectories, confirming and mapping new tunnels, and facilitating stakeholder integration. This capability will provide cost savings by allowing USBP to perform these duties in an integrated and efficient manner, reducing resource needs and improving detection results. It will also benefit numerous external stakeholders, including state/local/tribal law enforcement, Mexican authorities, and Canadian authorities through improved data sharing and stakeholder engagement. The Program Manager expects the ROI of the selected alternative to exceed the initial cost of investment. The formal LCCE is currently under development as the program approaches ADE-2A.  As such, a comparison and quantitative analysis of the investments life cycle cost and future benefits is unavailable at this time.","A 2010 study by HSI found that, Tunnels represent one form of cross-border vulnerability that is on the rise, with the discovery of over 150 illicit cross-border tunnels since 1990.

The CBTT Program began work on the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in March 2016. Progress on the AoA study stalled and was not yielding any results; therefore, in March 2017, the CBTT AoA Executive Steering Committee (ESC) directed the program to refocus the AoA study on Technical Readiness Levels (TRL) 2-9 and high-priority operational areas; (1) Nogales and Otay Mesa; (3) Calexico; (4) San Luis; (5) Imperial Beach; (6) Douglas; (7) Naco; and (8) Tecata.
CBTT returned to the ARB on June 20, 2017 to provide a status update on the AoA approach and was granted permission to continue. Preliminary results of the AoA were briefed to the USM and ARB members on January 16, 2018. The USM elected to postpone the ARB until April 2018 when the final results of the AoA study are analyzed and briefed to the AoA ESC. AoA study results were briefed to the ARB on May 24, 2018.
Decision was made to continue Tech Demos to refine requirements for detection and return to the ARB for an ADE-2A/B for limited tunnel detection capability by January 31, 2019. The AoA scope was specific to the detection/projecting the trajectory capability gap; it did not cover predict, confirm/map, or coordinate the response to cross border tunnels along the Southwest Border. Therefore, CBP will continue Analyze/Select activities for the remaining capability gaps. Due to the action item extension that was granted as a result of the lapse in federal funding earlier this fiscal year, the ADE 2A/B ADE for the detection capability will need to be completed no later than September 3, 2019.",,6/7/2019 13:01,6/7/2019 13:01,,,8/29/2019 16:50,8/29/2019 16:50,Update Required,,,2020,9/20/2018 19:51,8/29/2019 16:50,9/20/2018 19:51
