In determining the ROI, the R21 Key Decision Point (KDP) 1 was completed in Jul 1995 and authorized entry into the programs Concept and Technology Demonstration phase under the authority of DOT. In Aug 1999, KDP2 authorized the program to proceed into the Capability Development and Demonstration phase. In Aug 2001, the Coast Guard awarded three R21 Phase I contracts to competing contractors to develop proposed system designs. The Phase I proposals were reviewed in late 2001 and the Phase II production contract RFP was issued in Feb 2002. Following a formal source selection process, the USCGs Source Selection Official (SSO) awarded the R21 Phase II production contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems in Sep 2002. In Jul 2005, DHS authorized the R21 program to proceed into the Production and Deployment phase and full rate production subsequently commenced in Sep 2005.   Internal Benefits: R21 is used to tailor CG response (including coordinating with local first responders and federal coordinators), significantly reducing response time to mariners in distress. The R21 system enhances the CGs ability to detect & respond to distress calls in the coastal zone, which directly benefits the U.S. publics marine safety & saves lives. Benefits also include system disaster recovery capabilities that have supported coordination in numerous federals regional response and remediation efforts by providing a critical communication backbone in the disaster regions. For example, the R21 system provided a communication system that supported efforts to re-open ports in NY and NJ after hurricane Sandy.   External Benefits of the R21 system: Provides capabilities to help ensure the successful outcome of Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. By May 2017, R21 has been used in more than 94,730 SAR cases. Advanced DF which moreaccurately identifies the location of callers with lines of bearing to the VHF radio transmission source which reduces response time & search area; Continuous, enhanced VHF-FM marine radio coverage out to 20 nautical miles from shore; improved ability to identify suspected hoax calls; Increases the number of voice channels; Digital voice recording w/ immediate playback; Timely flow of info between CG & other stakeholders.

The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2028 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)
   
Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in benefits to society.

By this fact alone, DHS, CG and TSA leadership agree that CAS provides positive ROI, but the ROI has diminished over the years due to obsolescence and security risks. Calculating the current ROI on this legacy system would require significant time and resources.  For a system that is planned for disposition, the time and resources required to calculate the current ROI have been reallocated by leadership for continued sustainment of the system. It should be noted that the CAS Suite is planned for disposal after all data is either converted and migrated to FMSII or transferred into the planned FMPDR after the USCG and TSA successfully go live on FMSII. 
Benefits Internal (Government): A benefit of the CAS suite is that the system supports  accounting, asset management, and procurement system for the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Agency. All financial transactions are consolidated in the CAS suite so that information can be reported to the Department of Homeland Security in a timely manner. The CAS suite records and tracks accounting and financial activities, ensuring that legislative, Government Accounting Office, Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Homeland Security requirements are captured. 
  
Benefits External (General Public):  The external benefits stems on continued service to the general public regarding support from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Agency.

The benefit of modernizing to a more efficient electronic interface is enhanced communications between CBP, PGAs, and the Trade Community, resulting in time savings for entry corrections, which allows for more timely cargo processing. For example, the Document Imaging System (DIS) will enable paper forms to be received and processed electronically, providing more efficiency at the Port of Entry (POE), saving time and money for the government and the Trade Community. Ultimately, the new functionality will allow more time for port personnel to focus on mission work, vs. clerical and administrative tasks. ACE's performance metrics map to and measure planned cost savings and efficiency improvements, as noted on the Operational Perf tab. ACE will save approximately $30M annually by decommissioning the legacy mainframe once Collections functionality is completed. Collections - R1 completed/deployed in Sep 2019, Releases 2-3 are currently funded and in development, and Releases 4-8 are currently unfunded. The program is seeking funds to complete the development of Collections in ACE and to retire the ACS mainframe. ACE reduces cost by providing CBP personnel with information to better target compliance and enforcement efforts, increase overall operational effectiveness andby creating one system that provides a single window for CBP to interact, manage, and oversee the import/export data, and enforcement systems to provide end-to-end visibility of the entire trade cycle.  The result is a force multiplication effect for CBP and PGAs that provides officers import processing and tracking, allowing more time and resources to target compliance, enforcement, and national security activities. Benefits of the ACE system include: 1) ACE is reliable, it has a rolling 12- month average availability of 99.96% (ACE metric & KPP). 2) ACE provides ATS with 100% of the targeting and selectivity data it requires (ACE metric & KPP). 3) Savings to CBP due to reduced Primary Processing Time (PPT) thus far in FY20 (thru Jun): $6.30M. 4) Savings to Trade due to Periodic Monthly Statements and Interest thus far in FY20: $246.446M. 5) Savings to CBP Periodic Monthly Statement thus far in FY20: $7.13M. Details from the latest report of ACE Program Metrics on the Operational Effectiveness of the ACE Program (thru Jun 2020) include: 1) Approx. 75,000 ACE Trade accounts have been created to date, an approximate increase of 10.29% over last year. 2) Average national truck primary processing time is 51.42 seconds for Jun 2020, a 45% improvement over the 93.7 second ACS baseline.",yes,no,1651-0136|1651-0024|1651-0105,David Morrell,1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior,4031.198,119.361,105.404,96.414,2001,2026,"The program received $10M in FY20 and $10M in FY21 for Development of Collections functionality, which is the reason for the percentage change from prior year Presidential Budget.",1 - continue as is,3,"Jun21 the program is migrating NACE

With this qualitative return on investment, the program helps meet the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for stakeholders. 
 Costs to support the O&M of SAP are approximately $20M annually and include government FTE, contractor support, software license agreements, and training.
 SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting. The elimination of duplicate entry manual processes in both asset and financial management have created significant cost savings.  The QPAM analysis in 1999 found that implementation of an ERP system would generate the following reductions in government labor related to asset and financial management:  Planning reduced by 38%, Budgeting by 8.6%, Acquisition by 27.4%, Pay and Expend by 50%, and Monitor and Control would be reduced by 46%.  The Strategic and Business/Mission Analysis shows the many benefits SAP provides to CBP/DHS including:  complete integration of business processes within one system; improved financial statement reporting and internal controls; reduced cycle-time; elimination of duplicate entry; improved data accuracy; single system reporting; enhanced analytical reporting; and compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems.
 The SAP program reports performance annually via the Operational Analysis (OA) covering the following areas:  Customer Results, Strategic and Business results, Financial Performance, Innovation, Performance Measure Results, and Risk Assessment.  Summary results are reported on the OA tab of this form.  The program reports on five metrics via the monthly reporting form.  Based on the Office of Finance Customer Satisfaction Surveys in late FY2019 and early FY2020 the SAP Overall Average Satisfaction Rating remained high at 3.98 out of a possible 5.0 across all survey components.  The Technical Performance Analysis of SAP shows the system availability is above 99% for the 2020 fiscal year to date, indicating little to no unplanned downtime for the SAP production server. Help desk performance remains high and the level I help desk are on target to exceed the 72% resolution rate resulting in a quick resolution for SAP users.  Inquiries to the help desk including phone calls, and emails have been resolved in an average of under 3 hours for the coming fiscal year.

Since that analysis, the NII Program has reached ADE-3 and is procuring and deploying the technology as planned.  The performance of the deployed NII technology supports the previously estimated ROI, and is achieving the projected benefits (internal and external; and quantitative and qualitative benefits). Continued benefits and the ROI have been validated through new technology specifications (throughput, accuracy, reliability, etc.) and acceptance tests of those specifications for new and replacement technology.  Actual performance in the field has validated the operational capabilities of the technology upon which the initial benefits were estimated and the ROI calculated. A new ROI has not been calculated but the reasonableness of the initial estimate is confirmed because the incurred program costs are near the LCCE and the quantitative benefits of technology capabilities are as estimated.  The qualitative benefits, including those to commercial trade, are supported by the timeliness of inspections and an increase customer satisfaction. The NII Program provides internal and external benefits that are quantified and used to calculate the ROI.  Internally, NII systems reduce the time to conduct a manual exam by over 93 percent; an NII exam takes 8 minutes and a manual exam takes 120 minutes. To quantify this reduction: over 20 million vessel and truck containers with a market value of about $1.5 trillion annually enter the United States at and between Ports Of Entry (POE). Of these containers, NII large-scale technology is used to inspect approximately 10 percent of the targeted vessel and truck containers (about 2 million containers). Without using NII technology, the same number of exams would take an additional 3.8 million man-hours or approximately 7,000 additional CBP officers. NII systems alsoprovide operational benefits spanning personnel safety, speed, and accuracy of detection. From an external perspective, the expedited inspection process - made possible with NII technologies - saves the trade industry an estimated 0.5-percent to 1.5-percent increase to the cost of goods that would be created if manual inspections were performed. This is cost avoidance to the trade industry of approximately $5.8 billion to $17.5 billion per year. This cost is based on a parametric estimate using current literature on the cost of transit time for the delivery of goods. While NII technology offers exceptional deterrence benefits at and between the Nations POEs, the greatest qualitative external benefit of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism.

However,  ATS continues to provide a significant ROI by streamlining the processing of passengers and cargo while increasing the likelihood of identifying threats to the Homeland (e.g., narcotics or weapons).  ATS has been operational since 2005.  ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by providing risk data on passengers and cargo.  Hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and passengers provide officers and agents valuable info for a potential action.  This is an invaluable resource capability.  ATS also continues to provide quality data by working with other government agencies to eliminate derogatory matches and potential threats that are deemed false positives.  ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characteristics provide information that assists in better targeting efforts.  Another benefit from ATS is that users receive critical information from hotlists produced on individuals and cargo that present targeted threats to the homeland. In some instances, via Visa Pre-Adjudication, passengers are vetted and denied visas prior to attempting to board an aircraft.  This reduces the workload for TSA screeners by reducing the number of potential threats screened because they are previously vetted.  This again saves critical time and money and provides a significant value to the security of our nation.  ATS provides significant benefits through various applications and models. From October 2019- June 2020 over 620,000,000 shipments were scored for targeting purposes.  This far exceeded the FY target goal. These are only a few examples of the multiple models in production within ATS.  ATS serves DHS Mission of Securing and Managing our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a significant benefit to the public.  ATS helps secure lawful trade and travel which is vital for national security and public safety.  Governmentally, ATS utilizes system engineering techniques to maintain a system of systems capability throughout its components.  ATS provides stakeholders valuable information to target and capture potential threats.  ATS is used as a source system to target threats and provide the useful information to boots on the ground teams that they can then use to make an informed decision on a passenger or cargo event.

DAIP measures program value by consistently monitoring performance to demonstrate the program is meeting the needs of the Agency and to ensure the program delivers expected value to disaster survivors and internal stakeholders. DAIP is reducing costs and improving efficiencies by streamlining and consolidating the delivery of disaster assistance to survivors. This single, online application eases the burden on disaster survivors and increases their access to disaster relief by creating a continually updated information clearinghouse that provides information on the benefits most valuable to a disaster survivor, such as housing, food and employment aid in both English and Spanish.

DAIPs application processing allows for survivors to apply for multiple forms of assistance across multiple agencies and programs with built in protections against waste, fraud and abuse.  For the period of actual and simulated activity, the sum of planning costs is $34.037M, DME, excluding planning costs, are $66.885M. O&M costs are $166.507M, for a total AoA Life Cycle Cost of $267.430M. The values of six benefit classifications have been evaluated. The AoA conducted in FY 2015 was based across the time span FY 2015 through FY 2023, DAIP has projected net benefits of $687.036M offset by a costs of $134.315M yielding a simple ROI of 4.11%, that is, each dollar invested returns greater than four dollars. These benefits are split between the taxpayer in reduced costs and additional services provided to the disaster survivor. The benefits of investing in DAIP will continue to improve service delivery, assist survivors and reduce duplicative costs by multiple agencies. Since the primary focus and mission of DAIP is to expedite and improve the delivery of assistance to survivors of disasters, virtually every operational performance metric associated with DAIP is related to customer satisfaction. These performance metrics are monitored and updated every month and illustrate a consistent level of performance in delivering improved access to disaster resources (especially compared with pre-Katrina processes and timelines).",yes,yes,,Jennifer Fiery,4 - Other certification with 4 or more years PM experience (within the last five years),412.356,12.755,12.759,12.76,2007,2024,There is no substantive difference between the PY and CY budget for this program.,4 - initiate modernization/replacement action,3,"Jun21 FEMA continues to experience a

The adjusted net benefits is the net present value and the difference between the total discounted baseline of $620.179 M and the adjusted program costs.  The benefits are in the form of reduced operational maintenance costs over the initial 14 years of the programs life cycle. The reduction in maintenance costs will be especially evident in the final years and are expected to greatly exceed current costs as the system became increasingly difficult or near impossible to maintain.     It reduces the possibility of missing potential terrorist who should have been intercepted by data integration and search capabilities.

An ROI of .12 indicates that IPAWS increases benefits to society such that the initial investment is recovered & a return (savings in excess of original investment) is incurred. We defined External Benefits as estimated cost savings for federal agencies using IPAWS & the value of advanced/post alerts & warnings in the preservation of life & protection of property. From a mathematical perspective, an ROI of 0.12 indicates that IPAWS has increased benefits to society such that the initial investment is recovered & a return (savings in excess of original investment) is incurred. 
    
Cost Savings for Federal Agencies: IPAWS is free for public safety officials at all levels & allows users to leverage the federal investment to send alerts & warning to citizens. NCMEC cancelled a cellular alerting contract valued at approx. $1M/year when the AMBER Alert capability via IPAWS was initiated in Dec 2012. Estimated cost for the National Weather Service to implement a national cellular alerting capability independent of IPAWS is estimated at $2M/year. Numerous other state & local authorities have benefitted from the federal investment in IPAWS as a national standard for alert & warning vice independently investing in unique alert & warning capabilities on their own.    
    
Lives Saved by IPAWS: Weather warnings issued in response to major weather events (such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, etc.) are highly effective in providing advance warnings with protective action information to allow people to evacuate or seek shelter. IPAWS evaluated weather-related fatalities & found a significant decrease in loss of life & severe injuries over the last 12 years (2007-2019), compared to the same period prior to the launch of IPAWS (1995-2006). Since we cannot definitively attribute this difference to IPAWS, we conservatively attribute 10% of the difference in lives saved per year to IPAWS, resulting in 115.32 lives saved. Combined with the 66 children rescued as a direct result of AMBER Alerts sent through WEA (data from NCMEC, 6/2019) this gives us a total of 181.32 lives saved by IPAWS as of 2020. 
   
The Cloud Migration will improve IPAWS infrastructure, its availability, & time it takes to disseminate alerts & warnings to the public upon receipt. This enhances effectiveness & efficiency of warning messages to all people in a danger area, increasing the likelihood that people receive immediate warning information to afford the maximum amount of time to take action & avoid or mitigate the impact of disaster. Disaster impact avoidance & mitigation benefits society by enabling people to take protective measures, saving lives & reducing the cost of response & recovery activities after a disaster.    
    
IPAWS also aims to increase population covered by PEP Stations & local level public safety officials with IPAWS access. The integrated interoperable systems & open standards interfaces create a simple gateway between public safety officials & multiple communications systems supporting access to public alert & warning messages.

The detailed analysis included developing Life Cycle Cost Estimates (LCCEs) for the three viable communication alternatives to compare to the Status Quo/Legacy Land Mobile Radio System (LMR) to conduct a financial analysis; 1) Conventional Vote Scan 2) Trunked, and 3) Simulcast. The financial analysis included ROI, Net Present Value, and Payback Period for each alternative using the Status Quo/Legacy LMR System as the baseline. Tools used to support analysis were Crystal Ball (for Monte Carlo simulations), the Automated Cost Estimating Integrated Tools Cost Estimating Relationship Library Tool, and MS Excel. The preferred alternative was, and remains, the conventional vote scan system because it possesses the lowest primary cost attribute in acquisition, and secondly, has the highest return on investment (ROI) and the lowest payback period. Cost avoidance and savings are applied through efficient acquisition processes to include more efficient LMR maintenance agreements, and the implementation of advanced technology communication equipment, where possible, that provides lower long-term maintenance cost. The LMR system and communications capabilities are critical to U.S. border protection and ensuring CBP law enforcement safety and security, and though advanced technology affords maintenance savings, that technology is increasing in cost.

The TIM Program supports eliminating redundant business practices and processes, TIM enables support for external stakeholders such as Maritime and Aviation transportation worker / traveler populations. The lifecycle costs are estimated as $1.257 billion, as approved by DHS CFO in July 2019. The TIM Program is able to support processing the volume of Security Threat Assessments (STAs) required by TSA's TWIC and TSA PreCheck programs, which together have averaged over 200,000 applications per month. TSA would not be able to support the volume levels of these fee bearing programs in a timely manner without TIM. A portion of the TIM Investment is supported by fees generated by these programs.
As demonstrated by reporting on operational performance metrics 230776 (Unit Cost of Processing) and 214428 (Operational Availability), TIM provides TSA internal benefits by enabling information sharing across TSA / DHS. Additionally,  TIM reports on Operational Performance metrics 214427 (Enroll Once Detect Many...), and 214431 (Security Threat Assessment Response Time...).
The TIM program is able to search and find applicants who have applied for multiple credentials or STAs to work in multiple transportation modes. This capability enables TSA to integrate enrollment information, which saves users time and money.
TIM's STA process uses biometric and biographic information to perform automated immigration, criminal history, finger print, and terrorist watch list checks. The transportation worker must have an approved STA to start or continue work, or even to apply for a job within the US transportation infrastructure. Any significant delays impact the worker and may also impact commerce.

However, ADIS produces significant cost avoidance benefits to the nation that include enhanced border security and enforcement of U.S. immigration laws by serving as the Department's primary provider of overstay status and biographic identity services. Deployed data exchange upgrades and matching process improvements shortened the Overstay Vetting Process, reducing the time ICE takes to act on an overstay from 45 days to 15 or fewer days. 
 
Ongoing enhancements to the overstay population also contributed to further data integrity improvements in the annual Congressional Overstay Report. The efficiency gained is replacing a one-time yearly data call using significant manual resources with a modern real-time reporting environment. The real time data exchange with the Intelligence Community also eliminates a one-month data delay and the need for manual/bulk data updates transferred historically by human courier. Any delay in data touch points pointing to subjects arriving and departing the country creates a gap in information for making national security decisions. By closing these information gaps, efficiencies are gained across the federal government in sharing data more effectively in a real time, leading to reduced analytic costs for the Intelligence Community in searching multiple systems for similar data and reduction in human resources needed to support the existing manual exchanges.
 
In FY21, CBP plans to expand its data sharing capabilities with the Department of Labor, Department of Commerce, Social Security Administration, and other Government agencies.  Additionally, ADISs reporting environment will be used to provide the statistics of the FY20 Entry and Exit Overstay Report.

Without BPES, USBP would be unable to perform critical functions to detect, identify, classify and resolve illegal border activity, limiting the effectiveness of the USBP mission and endangering national security. Because the BPES portfolio is responsible for serving as a major source of USBP systems and data integration for border activity, field Agents, USBP, DHS, and external stakeholder rely on BPES functionalities to perform their mission priorities. Some BPES capabilities improve agent capabilities 100% - meaning many of these border enforcement tasks would be impossible to conduct without BPES. Based on this alone, benefits of the BPES investment far exceed its program cost. In addition, USBP, CBP, other DHS Components (e.g., ICE, CIS, USCG, FEMA, S&T), other federal agencies (e.g., DOJ, DOS and DOD), state, local and foreign governments benefit from BPES by having access to shared information that heighten situational awareness and risk-based decision-making. These agencies achieve cost avoidance by not having to build their own systems which eliminates redundant processes, manpower and operational costs. BPES captures information on criminal prosecution activities, facilitating court submissions to DOJ. BPES provides workforce staffing information and tracks operational metrics linked with DHS, the FBI and ICE. This integration improves decision-making and supports the rapid deployment of USBP resources while reducing operational costs. BPES provides statistical reports that CBP and multiple DHS components (e.g., FEMA, ICE, CIS) use for strategic and tactical decision-making. It enables USBP to provide reliable statistical information in response to White House, Congress, OMB, GAO, IG, IA and other federal agency requirements, including those of the Departments of State and Justice as well as stateand foreign governments. Because BPES in many cases is the only source of real-time, reliable border enforcement information, BPES is a critical data and informational source for executive decision makers across government. BPES also crucially serves as an integration point leveraging information and technologies developed or used by other agencies.

Rev Mod completed the business solution framework and Decision Analysis (DA) of Alternatives in FY2018.  While an ROI was not required for the DA  (Rev Mod is a level 3 program), the Rev Mod Program estimates that full implementation will result in a decrease of up to 75% of the time spent by CBPs uniformed personnel, and 80% by non-uniformed personnel, in non-cargo related revenue collection activities.  In addition to decreasing the resource time spent on revenue collections Rev Mod plans to consolidate, automate, and streamline fragmented and manual revenue collections processes, documentation and procedures, improve payment options and reporting capabilities, and streamline facility inefficiencies with the modernized revenue processes.  Rev Mod intends to fill capability gaps by achieving the following goals: (1) reducing the labor-intensive manual processes of revenue collections at the POEs (2) increasing online and electronic payment options for the collection of duties, taxes, and fees (3) capturing in-scope revenue collection data at the transaction level to enable improved reporting and business analytics. Of the approximately $54B (21 million transactions annually) CBP collects in duties, taxes, and fees annually, nearly $1.5B and 4 million individual transactions are processed in the field by CBP Officers and support staff. Once fully implemented, Rev Mod solutions are projected to enable CBP to redirect more than 200,000 hrs of CBPOs and other port personnels time spent on the administrative processing of collections  to mission critical law enforcement and trade and travel facilitation duties. The trade and travel industries will benefit from Rev Mod's modernized options for transacting business with CBP.  Lastly, there aredirect correlations to economic benefit associated with the Rev Mod Program.  According to the University of Southern California CREATE study, for each additional CBP Officer, the estimated economic impact includes a $2 million increase in Gross Domestic Product, and this means that Rev Mod's reallocation of CBP Officers' time to facilitating trade and travel will potentially have a $360 million economic impact. Benefits include:  -Reduce ~95k hrs of CBPO time spent on collections, enabling ports to reallocate resources to focus on law enforcement activities  -Reduce 500k checks/wires annually received which cost CBP over $25/transaction to process  -Eliminate the use of ~125k hand-written, triplicate cash receipts used primarily for check deposits  -Eliminate costs associated with printing and mailing ~260k hardcopy bills annually. While Rev Mod is not yet operational, it has planned metrics, which align with planned outcomes: 1. Increase the number of online and electronic payment options for 15 duties, taxes and fees 2. Reduce the percentage of time CBPOs spend on revenue collection duties by 10% 3. Reduce the percentage of paper receipts (that is 368s) used at POEs 4.

According to a 2013 Resource Optimization Report to Congress, backed up by a 2020 CBP Cost Management Information System (CMIS) review, by investing in automated scheduling and timekeeping solutions, CBP's Office of Field Operations (OFO) could return 200 CBP Officers and Agricultural Specialists working as Timekeepers/Schedulers to their frontline inspectional and law enforcement duties. This results in an annual cost avoidance of $14M. CBP National Finance Center estimates that the number of non-OFO Timekeepers (~2,000) could be reduced by 15% as employees take on their own timecard responsibilities in webTA, resulting in an annual cost avoidance of $6M. In addition, the retirement of CBP's current timecard and scheduling tool, COSS, enables the Agency to avoid $5M of costs annually to maintain the system, as well as the ongoing challenges of keeping that system up-to-date with security requirements and legislative changes. Once the CTI Solution is in full operational capability (FY23), CTI expects an annual cost avoidance of ~$25M. Comparing these amounts to CTIs planned lifecycle cost of $94M shows that the investment could be repaid within 4 years. Additionally, based on the University of Southern California (USC) Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE) study on The Impact on the U.S. Economy of Changes in Wait Times At Ports of Entry, for each additional CBP Officer, the estimated economic impact includes a $2 million increase in Gross Domestic Product. This means that CTIs return of 200 CBP Officers and Agricultural Specialists to their frontline inspectional and law enforcement duties will potentially have a $200M plus up to the U.S. economy. From a qualitative perspective, CTI offers a number of compelling benefits. CTI is responsive to a mainframe retirement mandate from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the CBP Office of Information and Technology (OIT), as CTIsupports the retirement of the COSS mainframe application. In addition, CTI supports DHS in closing a 2010 DHS Office of Inspector General recommendation that all DHS components be brought on to the DHS timekeeping solution in order to save costs and improve efficiencies.

This means that for every dollar invested, the Government is realizing a cost savings of $12.52. A key conclusion of the Analysis of Alternatives is that there is no single technology to answer the question ""what is the best situational awareness technology for the southwest border?"" The answer depends on the specifics of each area, and cueing by one system to initiate tracking by another provides valuable synergies. For example, MVSS is effective for short and medium distance mobile surveillance, whereas the Mobile Surveillance Capability (MSC) solution is more effective for long distance mobile surveillance.  This approach requires a mix of both mobile and fixed alternatives.  MVSS units enable a wider area coverage with fewer resources than the base case scenario. MVSS improves efficiencies through monitoring by providing mobile electro-optical and infrared sensing capabilities that enable Agents to perform their missions. MVSS mobile capabilities are much more efficient than USBP agents on foot or horseback, covering a wider area with fewer resources. This is the preferred solution in certain urban, rural, and remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor with other systems like Integrated Fixed Towers.  MVSS will be deployed for day or night use when indicators signal that IoIs are approaching an area. Units will also be deployed to augment surveillance systems that have line-of-sight coverage gaps caused by existing infrastructure, terrain (e.g., ravines or washes), or vegetation. MVSS provides mobile surveillance and situational awareness in remote areas over a range of 40 feet to 5 miles from the deployment location, providing agents the ability to respond to threats in varying locations. Other benefits include increased situational awareness of land borders. The deployment of MVSS units in Rio Grande Valley (RGV) exceeded the material availability target of 75 percent, enabling Agents to utilize the technology whenever needed. Furthermore, the mean time to repair the units is being managed toward a target not exceed 8 hours a month, as is the number of corrective maintenance actions to not exceed 2 times a month. These performance metrics advance the CBP Goal: Advance Comprehensive Border Security Management and the DHS Goal: to Secure U.S. Air, Land and Sea Borders and Approaches. USBP has greater flexibility in terms of where assets are deployed, based on threats and needs. In addition, Agents are freed to focus on areas with the highest threats, and provided greater lead time to plan effective interdictions. Most importantly, Agent safety is prioritized as they are less likely to work in entrenched, isolated areas or areas with poor visibility, leaving them vulnerable to potentially harmful engagements.  Lastly, MVSS helps minimize vulnerabilities resulting from the human factor. Despite training and experience, Agents are vulnerable to compromising operational effectiveness due to fatigue and human errors.  In contrast, one or two Agents equipped with the MVSS are able to surveil up to a 5-mile radius, and can respond to illegal activities in a fraction of the time it would take Agents on foot. The MVSS will enable the USBP stations to maintain situational awareness with fewer Agents, e.g. one-man team surveilling a 5 mile radius versus one 1 Agent, per one mile border, thereby resulting in cost savings and improving operational effectiveness.",no,no,,Igor Bosnjak,1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior,96.379,28.773,3.996,4.006,2015,2030,"Funding is expected in FY21 and beyond to support this investment, INVEST is expected to be updated to reflect the RAD decisions in late September 2020.

At completion, TVS will provide biometric matching services for all travel modes including air, land, and sea. The qualitative benefits deriving from this comprehensive solution are being realized today in the commercial air exit environment. The solution builds on a partnership with the air travel industry based on a cost-sharing model with airlines and airports. In this partnership, which now numbers 28 participating airlines and airports, CBP is working with air transportation stakeholders to lead the transformation of air travel using biometrics as the key to enhance security, and dramatically improve the entire traveler experience. CBP is realizing the benefit of a greater assurance of traveler identity through the use of biometrics without negatively impacting the airline boarding process. For example, one of CBPs biometric exit partners has reported that the new process allows it to reduce boarding time of an A380, the largest passenger plane in operation, from 50 to 20 minutes. In this partnership, airports or airlines purchase, operate, and maintain the biometric capture device at each departure gate. Each device costs on average $5,000-$30,000 for each of the 2,000 gates where this equipment is installed. Additionally, airports are updating existing infrastructure and network connections and developing their own software to communicate with CBPs TVS. The program conservatively estimates a cost savings of $60 million just in the procurement of the biometric capture devices -- a significant quantitative benefit. Additional cost savings will be further realized as airlines and airports continue to operate and maintain the devices along with any infrastructure investments. For air entry operations, CBPs new simplified arrival process quickly and reliably uses the travelers face to biometrically verify identity and retrieve traveler records automatically. Current data shows that arriving passengers clear customs processing 35 percent faster with the new biometric process, which eliminates manual, time-consuming steps, such as document scans and fingerprint captures, that delay the inspection process. With a faster clearance process, airlines, airports, and travelers benefit from shorter connection times and standardized arrival procedures. In land operations, CBP is exploring, through technology demonstrations, using a gallery of expected border crossers and validating the concept of face as a token to close the arrival/departure reporting gap in the pedestrian and vehicle environment. Qualitative benefits that may be realized include replacing the use of travel documents to facilitate the border crossing experience. Since sea and air operations are similar, CBP is using the air exit model and the establishment of a partnership with cruise line operators who will procure, operate, and maintain the biometric capture devices.",yes,yes,,Mike Gaige,1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior,234.17,61,25.5,25.5,2017,2031,There have been no changes to PY and CY funding levels when compared to the FY21 Presidents Budget.,1 - continue as is,2,"Apr21, the fee funded structure of the BEE program is a high impact risk and issue.

The CAT Program was originally a project under the Passenger Screening Program where the ROI was calculated to as -35%. The CAT Program does not intend on revisiting ROI at this stage of its ALF and will leverage the PSP ROI. Therefore, the ROI of -35% would indicate that O&M will likely decrease -- or external benefits increase -- such that 65% of the initial acquisition costs will be recovered and 35% of the initial acquisition cost will not be recovered. The program will not generate any additional ""return"" or cost savings, this is due to the fact that investment is in security, which typically has negative ROI, since the upfront costs are very high and security benefits are hard to monetize. The ROI was calculated in the following manner. The status quo assumptions were analyzed for year by year and overall cost information. The next step was to calculate the year by year and overall cost of the chosen scenario and its benefits. The deltas for the year over year comprise the incremental investment required for the scenario. Next, it is necessary to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of both the costs and the benefits of the scenarios. A discount rate is given in the OMB A11 guidance. Subtract the discounted cost from the benefit. Then lastly divide the subtracted value by the NPV of the cost to calculate the ROI. The major internal benefits are the ability to provide many of the largest airports with a variety of equipment and provide a large scope of threat detection by allowing the procurement of different detection classes. It would also help to speed the deployment of a variety emerging technologies to the largest of airports to provide coverage to a major percentage of the traveling public.
