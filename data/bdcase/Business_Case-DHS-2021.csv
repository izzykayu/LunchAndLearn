In determining the ROI, the R21 Key Decision Point (KDP) 1 was completed in Jul 1995 and authorized entry into the programs Concept and Technology Demonstration phase under the authority of DOT. In Aug 1999, KDP2 authorized the program to proceed into the Capability Development and Demonstration phase. In Aug 2001, the Coast Guard awarded three R21 Phase I contracts to competing contractors to develop proposed system designs. The Phase I proposals were reviewed in late 2001 and the Phase II production contract RFP was issued in Feb 2002. Following a formal source selection process, the USCGs Source Selection Official (SSO) awarded the R21 Phase II production contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems in Sep 2002. In Jul 2005, DHS authorized the R21 program to proceed into the Production and Deployment phase and full rate production subsequently commenced in Sep 2005.   Internal Benefits: R21 is used to tailor CG response (including coordinating with local first responders and federal coordinators), significantly reducing response time to mariners in distress. The R21 system enhances the CGs ability to detect & respond to distress calls in the coastal zone, which directly benefits the U.S. publics marine safety & saves lives. Benefits also include system disaster recovery capabilities that have supported coordination in numerous federals regional response and remediation efforts by providing a critical communication backbone in the disaster regions. For example, the R21 system provided a communication system that supported efforts to re-open ports in NY and NJ after hurricane Sandy.

The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2028 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)
   
Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in benefits to society.

By this fact alone, DHS, CG and TSA leadership agree that CAS provides positive ROI, but the ROI has diminished over the years due to obsolescence and security risks. Calculating the current ROI on this legacy system would require significant time and resources.  For a system that is planned for disposition, the time and resources required to calculate the current ROI have been reallocated by leadership for continued sustainment of the system. It should be noted that the CAS Suite is planned for disposal after all data is either converted and migrated to FMSII or transferred into the planned FMPDR after the USCG and TSA successfully go live on FMSII. 
Benefits Internal (Government): A benefit of the CAS suite is that the system supports  accounting, asset management, and procurement system for the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Agency. All financial transactions are consolidated in the CAS suite so that information can be reported to the Department of Homeland Security in a timely manner. The CAS suite records and tracks accounting and financial activities, ensuring that legislative, Government Accounting Office, Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Homeland Security requirements are captured. 
  
Benefits External (General Public):  The external benefits stems on continued service to the general public regarding support from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Agency.

ROI is based on O&M savings in the following areas: Help desk support; Application, hardware and software maintenance; Data center labor; User Training and Materials; Security Testing; Operational analyses due to lower usage of the mainframe platform; Efficiencies from the CBP target architecture from getting off the mainframe; Reduced licensing costs; Shared system components; Standardizing certification and accreditation; and Improving scalability and reliability and instituting open standards.  The benefits of modernizing to a more efficient electronic interface will enhance communications between CBP, PGAs, and the Trade Community. The improved communications will provide time savings for entry corrections and allow for more timely cargo processing. For example, the Document Imaging System (DIS) will enable paper forms to be received and processed electronically, providing more efficiency at the Port of Entry (POE) and saving time and money for the government and the Trade Community. Ultimately the new functionality will free up more time for port personnel to perform mission work rather than clerical and administrative tasks. ACE's performance metrics map and measure planned cost savings and efficiency improvements that are noted in the Operational Performance section of this document. ACE will save $36.6M annually by decommissioning the legacy mainframe, once Collections functionality is completed. Currently Collections - R1 is funded with completion scheduled for Jul 2019; Collections - Releases 2-4 are currently unfunded. The program is seeking funds to complete the development of Collections in ACE and to retire the mainframe. ACE reduces cost by providing CBP personnel with information to better target their compliance and enforcement efforts, increase overall operational effectiveness and by creating one system that provides a single window for CBP to interact, manage, and oversee the import/export data, and enforcement systems to provide end-to-end visibility of the entire trade cycle. The result is a force multiplication effect for CBP and PGAs that provides officers import processing and tracking, allowing more time and resources to target compliance, enforcement, and national security activities. Below are examples of benefits of the ACE system: 1) ACE is reliable, it has a rolling 12 month average availability of 99.73% (ACE metric & KPP). 2) ACE provides 99.999% of all data required to ATS for targeting and selectivity (ACE metric & KPP). 3) Savings to CBP due to reduced Primary Processing Time (PPT) thus far in FY19 (thru Jun 2019): $6.83M. 4) Savings to Trade due to Periodic Monthly Statements and Interest thus far in FY19 (thru Jun 2019): $203.616M. 5) Savings to CBP Periodic Monthly Statement thus far in FY19 (thru Jun 2019): $6.38M.

SAP adequately addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  
Total cost to support the operations and maintenance of the SAP system are approximately $20M annually.  These costs include government FTE, contractor support, software license agreements, and miscellaneous equipment and training.
As an integrated ERP system, SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting.  The elimination of duplicate entry manual processes in both asset and financial management have created significant cost savings.  The QPAM analysis in 1999 found that implementation of an ERP system would generate the following reductions in government labor related to asset and financial management:  Planning reduced by 38%, Budgeting by 8.6%, Acquisition by 27.4%, Pay and Expend by 50%, and Monitor and Control would be reduced by 46%.  The Strategic and Business/Mission Analysis shows the many benefits SAP provides to CBP/DHS including:  complete integration of business processes within one system; improved financial statement reporting and internal controls; reduced cycle-time; elimination of duplicate entry; improved data accuracy; single system reporting; enhanced analytical reporting; and compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems.
The SAP program reports performance annually via the Operational Analysis (OA) covering the following areas:  Customer Results, Strategic and Business results, Financial Performance, Innovation, Performance Measure Results, and Risk Assessment.  Summary results are reported on the OA tab of this form.  The program reports on five metrics in the INVEST system via the monthly reporting form.  Based on the Office of Finance Customer Satisfaction Surveys in late FY2018 and early FY2019 the SAP Overall Average Satisfaction Rating remained consistently high at 3.94 out of a possible 5.0 across all survey components.  The Technical Performance Analysis of SAP shows the system planned availability is above 99% for the 2019 fiscal year to date, indicating little to no unplanned downtime for the SAP production server.  The team remains committed to primary stakeholders with Strategic and Business engagement at least once a quarter.  Help desk performance remains high and the level I help desk are on target to meet the 72% resolution rate resulting in a quick resolution for SAP users to their inquiries.

APIS improves CBP's efficiency to obtain advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  APIS is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. Benefits provided by APIS to both internal and external to the government cannot be easily quantified. In terms of internal benefits, APIS has proven to be exceptionally valuable and useful.  It is the most critical current data source available to match arrivals and departures against the various watch lists. APIS data is critical to CBP biographical entry/exit systems.  APIS is the single best method by which CBP obtains advance data to screen potential terrorists and in turn bounce their names or aliases against watch lists.  The apprehension of the Times Square Bomber is the most visible recent example in that APIS alerted CBP that the bomber was attempting to flee the country and where he could be apprehended.
The computerized analysis of inbound and outbound passengers dramatically increases the efficiency of analysis of high risk traveler identification, as well as, facilitation of low risk passenger traffic.

Since that analysis, the NII Program has reached ADE-3 and is procuring and deploying the technology as planned.  The performance of the deployed NII technology supports the previously estimated ROI, and is achieving the projected benefits (internal and external; and quantitative and qualitative benefits). Continued benefits and the ROI have been validated through new technology specifications (throughput, accuracy, reliability, etc.) and acceptance tests of those specifications for new and replacement technology.  Actual performance in the field has validated the operational capabilities of the technology upon which the initial benefits were estimated and the ROI calculated. A new ROI has not been calculated but the reasonableness of the initial estimate is confirmed because the incurred program costs are near the LCCE and the quantitative benefits of technology capabilities are as estimated.  The qualitative benefits, including those to commercial trade, are supported by the timeliness of inspections and the results of the 2016, 2017, and 2018 calendar year Operational Analyses.
The NII Program provides internal and external benefits that are quantified and used to calculate the ROI.  Internally, NII systems reduce the time to conduct a manual exam by over 93 percent; an NII exam takes 8 minutes and a manual exam takes 120 minutes. To quantify this reduction: over 20 million vessel and truck containers with a market value of about $1.5 trillion annually enter the United States at and between Ports Of Entry (POE). Of these containers, NII large-scale technology is used to inspect approximately 10 percent of the targeted vessel and truck containers (about 2 million containers). Without using NII technology, the same number of exams would take an additional 3.8 million man-hours or approximately 7,000 additionalCBP officers. NII systems also provide operational benefits spanning personnel safety, speed, and accuracy of detection.
From an external perspective, the expedited inspection process - made possible with NII technologies - saves the trade industry an estimated 0.5-percent to 1.5-percent increase to the cost of goods that would be created if manual inspections were performed. This is cost avoidance to the trade industry of approximately $5.8 billion to $17.5 billion per year. This cost is based on a parametric estimate using current literature on the cost of transit time for the delivery of goods. While NII technology offers exceptional deterrence benefits at and between the Nations POEs, the greatest qualitative external benefit of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism.

However, ATS continues to provide a significant ROI by streamlining the processing of passengers and cargo while increasing the likelihood of identifying threats to the Homeland (e.g., narcotics or weapons). ATS has been operational since 2005. ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by providing risk data on passengers and cargo. Hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and passengers provide officers and agents valuable info for a potential action. This is an invaluable resource capability. ATS also continues to provide quality data by working with other government agencies to eliminate derogatory matches and potential threats that are deemed false positives. ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characteristics provide information that assists in better targeting efforts. Another benefit from ATS is that users receive critical information from hotlists produced on individuals and cargo that present targeted threats to the homeland. In some instances, via Visa Pre-Adjudication, passengers are vetted and denied visas prior to attempting to board an aircraft. This reduces the workload for TSA screeners by reducing the number of potential threats screened because they are previously vetted. This again saves critical time and money and provides a significant value to the security of our nation. ATS provides significant benefits through various applications and models. One example is the Air Express Intellectual Property Rights model within ATS which has captured over $188M of goods in FY18. From October 2017- June 2018 over 601,000,000 shipments were scored for targeting purposes. This far exceeded the FY target goal. These are only a few examples of the multiple models in production within ATS.   ATS serves DHS Mission of Securing and Managing our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public. By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a significant benefit to the public. ATS helps secure lawful trade and travel which is vital for national security and public safety. Governmentally, ATS utilizes system engineering techniques to maintain a system of systems capability throughout its components. ATS provides stakeholders valuable information to target and capture potential threats.

DAIP measures program value by consistently monitoring performance to demonstrate the program is meeting the needs of the Agency and to ensure the program delivers expected value to disaster survivors and internal stakeholders. DAIP is reducing costs and improving efficiencies by streamlining and consolidating the delivery of disaster assistance to survivors. This single, online application eases the burden on disaster survivors and increases their access to disaster relief by creating a continually updated information clearinghouse that provides information on the benefits most valuable to a disaster survivor, such as housing, food and employment aid in both English and Spanish.  DisasterAssistance.gov reduces the time needed to apply for aid and check the status of claims while decreasing redundancy in application forms and processes. DAIPs web portal provides cost avoidance to FEMA for every registration or account inquiry done on-line or mobile device over traditional call-center or in-person applications. As shown in the Hurricanes Sandy, Harvey, Irma & Marie responses, the DisasterAssistance.gov portal provides a cost effective alternative to increasing call center capacity and volume without any additional cost to the American Taxpayer. DAIP improves government efficiencies at FEMA, DHS and across the federal government.

These benefits are split between the taxpayer in reduced costs and additional services provided to the disaster survivor. The benefits of investing in DAIP will continue to improve service delivery, assist survivors and reduce duplicative costs by multiple agencies. Since the primary focus and mission of DAIP is to expedite and improve the delivery of assistance to survivors of disasters, virtually every operational performance metric associated with DAIP is related to customer satisfaction.

An asset equipped with modern C4ISR equipment will be able to combine its own sensor data with data from partner agency assets or other Coast Guard sources (e.g., other ships, aircraft and shore commands). Coast Guard units can now operate with the same information available to other friendly assets. This facilitates tactical decisions for operational commandersboth on-scene and from afarand enhances situational awareness within the United States maritime areas. The Coast Guard uses these features to mitigate possible threats from terrorists and other criminals, while observing and assisting legitimate users in American ports, waterways, and coastal regions. 

These C4ISR systems support the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and DHS strategic goals, and using them ultimately results in lives saved, drugs interdicted, and perpetrators apprehended. An ROI analysis would not be informative, as this is not a financially-driven initiative. The return on investment for C4ISR Segment 2 is represented by numerous qualitative enhancements over the Segment 1 system; these upgrades aid the Coast Guard in meeting mission needs. Segment 2 is designed to meet the critical interoperability requirements for exchanging information with mission partners (DOD, DHS, OGAs and state, local, and/or foreign governments). Other user efficiencies provided by Segment 2 include fully capable transmit/receive Link-11 and Link-16 solutions, a real-time tactical domain with redundancy and failover capability, IFF tracker integration, increased storage capacity and reliability, a Central Control System to execute admin functions from any console, and network management and system monitoring upgrades.

However, the program is now primarily working on the C4ISR system on the NSC. The program was designed with a segmented approach for development and deployment.
Currently, C4ISR Segment 2 Spiral 2 (S2S2, now also called Sea Commander) is being deployed to the NSC as the integrated command control baseline. Operational testing of the C4ISR S2S2 did (at least partially) occur in accordance with the C4ISR requirements as identified in the NSC ORD; however, the C4ISR requirements as identified in the S2S2 ORD may not have been specifically incorporated into the NSC testing. Testing commenced in Nov. 2017, and is substantially complete, with the final report pending and DHS LOA awaiting that report. A challenge regarding the testability of a portion of the S2S2 requirements has been identified.
The current structure of the C4ISR Program, as linked to the various assets is not necessarily desirable from the perspective of program governance.

The adjusted net benefits is the net present value and the difference between the total discounted baseline of $620.179 M and the adjusted program costs.     
The benefits are in the form of reduced operational maintenance costs over the initial 14 years of the programs life cycle. The reduction in maintenance costs will be especially evident in the final years and are expected to greatly exceed current costs as the system became increasingly difficult or near impossible to maintain.    
TECS supports the DHS and CBP missions by protecting the nation from the entry of dangerous or illegal people, ensuring efficient flow of lawful people crossing US borders and enabling effective decision making through rigorous screening of travelers to provide improved intelligence and information sharing. It reduces the possibility of missing potential terrorist who should have been intercepted by data integration and search capabilities.

An ROI of .18 indicates that IPAWS increases benefits to society such that the initial investment is recovered & a return (savings in excess of original investment) is incurred. We defined External Benefits as estimated cost savings for federal agencies using IPAWS & the value of advanced/post alerts and warnings in the preservation of life and protection of property. This calculation uses quantitative analysis to capture both quantitative & qualitative benefits resulting from IPAWS.   
   
Cost Savings for Federal Agencies: IPAWS is free for public safety officials at all levels & allows users to leverage the federal investment to send alerts & warning to citizens. NCMEC cancelled a cellular alerting contract valued at approx. $1M/year when the AMBER Alert capability via IPAWS was initiated in Dec 2012. Estimated cost for the National Weather Service to implement a national cellular alerting capability independent of IPAWS is estimated at $2M/year. Numerous other state & local authorities have benefitted from the federal investment in IPAWS as a national standard for alert and warning vice independently investing in unique alert & warning capabilities on their own.   
   
Lives Saved by IPAWS: In our research we learned that weather warnings issued in response to tornadoes & hurricanes have been highly effective in providing advance warnings with protective action information to allow people to evacuate or seek shelter. IPAWS evaluated tornado & hurricane fatalities & found a significant decrease in loss of life and severe injuries over the last 119 years (2007-2018), compared to the same period prior to the launch of IPAWS (1995-2006). Since we cannot definitively attribute this difference to IPAWS, we conservatively attribute 10% of the difference in lives saved per year to IPAWS, resulting in 80.9 lives saved. Combined with the 56 children rescued as a direct result of AMBER Alerts sent through WEA (data from NCMEC, 6/2019) this gives us a total of 136.9 lives saved by IPAWS as of 2019
  
The Cloud Migration will improve IPAWS infrastructure, its availability, & time it takes to disseminate alerts & warnings to the public upon receipt. This enhances effectiveness & efficiency of warning messages to all people in a danger area, increasing the likelihood that people receive immediate warning information to afford the maximum amount of time to take action and avoid or mitigate the impact of disaster. Disaster impact avoidance & mitigation benefits society by enabling people to take protective measures, saving lives & reducing the cost of response & recovery activities after a disaster.   
   
IPAWS also aims to increase population covered by PEP Stations & local level public safety officials with IPAWS access. The integrated interoperable systems & open standards interfaces create a simple gateway between public safety officials & multiple communications systems supporting access to public alert & warning messages.

Compared to the baseline operating costs of $3,634M with the new operating cost of $562M from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the RVSS operating costs are estimated to be considerably lower. ROI calculation: [(Baseline Operating Costs {with agents only} minus RVSS Upgrade Operating Costs) divided by the Capital Investment Cost], minus 1 providing the same level of surveillance. The key internal benefit is that for a lower overall operating cost, the investment will provide the USBP with a persistent surveillance capability, which will enable them to detect, identify, and track Items of Interest (IoIs), thus enabling them to monitor an Area of Interest more efficiently and effectively. Other benefits include: facilitate mission accomplishments; allow agents to be re-aligned since it acts as a force multiplier; agents will be safer since fewer will be required in the field for surveillance; technology will be used only in areas in which it performs well; and improved data will be available (recorded video imagery) for successful law enforcement accomplishment versus the baseline. Additional benefits include maintaining low logistics support costs, a minimal number of trouble tickets, a high operational availability, a low number of priority 1 downtime events, and a low number of priority 2 and 3 corrective actions.   External Benefits: The program could result in indirect and long-term beneficial impacts by reducing the adverse impacts of illegal cross-border violator activities in the project area.  The RVSS towers would enhance CBPs detection and threat classification capabilities and increase the efficiency of operational activities within the area of tower coverage.  Over time the enhancement of detection capabilities and an increase in operational efficiency could increase the deterrence of illegal cross-border violator activity within the area of tower coverage. Planned Outcomes: The intended mission outcomes are three-fold (1) Increase situational awareness provided on the Southwest Border while leveraging the added range potential of cameras systems where practical. (2) Replace the current analog system with a more secure digital system. (3) The RVSS Upgrade is expected to enhance the current mission through early detection of border incursions, through enhanced identification and classification of the threat, and through an improved ability to track items of interest. US Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in March 2014 and April 2015 that CBP had made progress in deploying programs under the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan (the Plan), but could take additional actions to strengthen its management of the Plan and its related programs.

However, ADIS produces significant cost avoidance benefits to the nation that include enhanced border security and enforcement of U.S. immigration laws by serving as the Department's primary provider of overstay status and biographic identity services. Deployed data exchange upgrades and matching process improvements shortened the Overstay Vetting Process, reducing the time ICE takes to act on an overstay from 45 days to 15 or fewer days. 
 
Ongoing enhancements to the overstay population also contributed to further data integrity improvements in the annual Congressional Overstay Report. The efficiency gained is replacing a one-time yearly data call using significant manual resources with a modern real-time reporting environment. The real time data exchange with the Intelligence Community also eliminates a one-month data delay and the need for manual/bulk data updates transferred historically by human courier. Any delay in data touch points pointing to subjects arriving and departing the country creates a gap in information for making national security decisions. By closing these information gaps, efficiencies are gained across the federal government in sharing data more effectively in a real time, leading to reduced analytic costs for the Intelligence Community in searching multiple systems for similar data and reduction in human resources needed to support the existing manual exchanges.

These agencies achieve cost avoidance by not having to build their own systems which eliminates redundant processes, manpower and operational costs enabling them to address their missions quickly and effectively. BPES captures information on criminal prosecution activities, facilitating court submissions to DOJ. BPES provides workforce staffing information and tracks operational metrics linked with DHS, the FBI and ICE. This integration improves decision-making and supports the rapid deployment of USBP resources while reducing operational costs. BPES provides statistical reports that CBP and multiple DHS components (e.g., FEMA, ICE, CIS) use for strategic and tactical decision-making. It enables USBP to provide reliable statistical information in response to White House, Congress, OMB, GAO, IG, IA and other federal agency requirements, including those of the Departments of State and Justice as well as state and foreign governments.

The goal is to modernize the revenue processes, resulting in a significant savings in time spent performing revenue collection activities. Rev Mod completed the business solution framework and Decision Analysis (DA) of Alternatives in FY2018.  While an ROI was not required for the DA, the Rev Mod Program estimates that full implementation will result in a decrease of up to 75% of the time spent by CBPs uniformed personnel, and 80% by non-uniformed personnel, in revenue collection activities.  In addition to decreasing the resource time spent on revenue collections CBP plans to consolidate, automate, and streamline fragmented and manual revenue collections processes, documentation and procedures, improve payment options and reporting capabilities, streamline facility inefficiencies and improve the legacy legal framework with the modernized revenue processes.  Rev Mod intends to fill capability gaps by achieving the following goals:
 (1) reducing or eliminating the labor-intensive manual processes of revenue collections
 (2) increasing online and electronic payment options 
 (3) providing revenue collections data at the transaction level for improved reporting and analysis
Of the approximately $45B (21 million transactions annually) CBP collects in duties, taxes, and fees annually, nearly $1.5B and 4 million individual transactions are processed in the field by CBP Officers and support staff. Rev Mod is targeted to allow nearly 180 CBP Officers and 136 non-uniformed CBP personnel to shift the time currently spent on revenue collection activities, to mission critical law enforcement and trade and travel facilitation duties, when transactions are moved to electronic platforms. In addition to CBP savings and efficiencies, the trade and travel industries will benefit from Rev Mod's modernized options for transacting business with CBP.  Lastly, there are direct correlations to economic benefit associated with the Rev Mod Program.  According to the University of Southern California CREATE study, for each additional CBP Officer, the estimated economic impact includes a $2 million increase in Gross Domestic Product, and this means that Rev Mod's reallocation of CBP Officers' time to facilitating trade and travel will potentially have a $360 million economic impact.  Rev Mod stakeholders include Trade and Travel communities, as well as the Offices of Finance, Trade and Field Operations.
 Benefits include:
 -Reduce ~95k hours of CBPO time spent performing cashier duties at the CBP Ports of Entry, enabling ports to reallocate resources to increase focus on inspection and enforcement activities
 -Achieve cost savings from enabling electronic payment of duties, fees, and bills; reduce 500k checks/wires annually received which cost CBP over $25/transaction to process
 -Eliminate the use of ~125k hand-written, triplicate cash receipts used primarily for check deposits
 -Using electronic billing, eliminate costs associated with printing and mailing ~260k hardcopy bills annually

This means that for every dollar invested, the Government is realizing a cost savings of $12.52. A key conclusion of the Analysis of Alternatives is that there is no single technology to answer the question ""what is the best situational awareness technology for the southwest border?"". The answer depends on the specifics of each area, and cueing by one system to initiate tracking by another provides valuable synergies. For example, MVSS is effective for short and medium distance mobile surveillance, whereas the Mobile Surveillance Capability (MSC) solution is more effective for long distance mobile surveillance.  This approach requires a mix of both mobile and fixed alternatives.  MVSS units enable a wider area coverage with fewer resources than the base case scenario. MVSS improves efficiencies through monitoring by providing mobile electro-optical and infrared sensing capabilities that enable Agents to perform their missions. MVSS mobile capabilities are much more efficient than USBP agents on foot or horseback, covering a wider area with fewer resources. This is the preferred solution in certain urban, rural, and remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor with other systems like Integrated Fixed Towers.  MVSS will be deployed for day or night use when indicators signal that IoIs are approaching an area. Units will also be deployed to augment surveillance systems that have line-of-sight coverage gaps caused by existing infrastructure, terrain (e.g., ravines or washes), or vegetation. MVSS provides mobile surveillance and situational awareness in remote areas over a range of 40 feet to 5 miles from the deployment location, providing agents the ability to respond to threats in varying locations. Other benefits include increased situational awareness of land borders. The deployment of MVSS units in Rio Grande Valley (RGV) exceeded the material availability target of 75 percent, enabling Agents to utilize the technology whenever needed. Furthermore, the mean time to repair the units is being managed toward a target not exceed 8 hours a month, as is the number of corrective maintenance actions to not exceed 2 times a month. These performance metrics advance the CBP Goal: Advance Comprehensive Border Security Management and the DHS Goal: to Secure U.S. Air, Land and Sea Borders and Approaches. USBP has greater flexibility in terms of where assets are deployed, based on threats and needs. In addition, Agents are freed to focus on areas with the highest threats, and provided greater lead time to plan effective interdictions. Most importantly, Agent safety is prioritized as they are less likely to work in entrenched, isolated areas or areas with poor visibility, leaving them vulnerable to potentially harmful engagements.  Lastly, MVSS helps minimize vulnerabilities resulting from the human factor. Despite training and experience, Agents are vulnerable to compromising operational effectiveness due to fatigue and human errors.  In contrast, one or two Agents equipped with the MVSS are able to surveil up to a 5-mile radius, and can respond to illegal activities in a fraction of the time it would take Agents on foot. The MVSS will enable the USBP stations to maintain situational awareness with fewer Agents, e.g. one-man team surveilling a 5 mile radius versus one 1 Agent, per one mile border, thereby resulting in cost savings and improving operational effectiveness.",no,no,,Craig Doheny,1 - FAC-P/PM(DAWIA-3)- Senior,73.665,22.714,28.773,0.472,2015,2030,There are no significant changes.,,3,"The KPP for Detection and Identification threshold needs to be adjusted, as it is impracticable.

At completion, TVS will provide biometric matching services for all travel modes including air, land, and sea. The qualitative benefits deriving from this comprehensive solution are being realized today in the commercial air exit environment. The solution builds on a partnership with the air travel industry based on a cost-sharing model with airlines and airports. In this partnership, which now numbers 28 participating airlines and airports, CBP is working with air transportation stakeholders to lead the transformation of air travel using biometrics as the key to enhancing security, and dramatically improve the entire traveler experience. CBP is realizing the benefit of a greater assurance of traveler identity through the use of biometrics without negatively impacting the airline boarding process, For example, one of CBPs biometric exit partners has reported that the new process allows it to reduce boarding time of an A380, the largest passenger plane in operation, from 50 to 20 minutes. In this partnership, airports or airlines purchase, operate, and maintain the biometric capture device at each departure gate. Each device costs on average $30,000-$40,000 for each of the 2,000 gates where this equipment is installed. Additionally, airports are updating existing infrastructure and network connections and developing their own software to communicate with CBPs TVS. The program conservatively estimates a cost savings of $60 million just in the procurement of the biometric capture devices -- a significant quantitative benefit. Additional cost savings will be further realized as airlines and airports continue to operate and maintain the devices along with any infrastructure investments. For air entry operations, CBPs new simplified arrival process quickly and reliably uses the travelers face to biometrically verify identity and retrieve traveler records automatically. Current data shows that arriving passengers clear customs processing 35 percent faster with the new biometric process that eliminates manual, time consuming steps such as document scans and fingerprint captures, which delay the inspection process. With a faster clearance process, airlines, airports, and travelers benefit from shorter connection times and standardized arrival procedures. In land operations, CBP is exploring through technology demonstrations the use of a gallery of expected border crossers and validating the concept of face as a token to close the arrival/departure reporting gap in the pedestrian and vehicle environment. Additional benefits that may be realized include replacing the use of travel documents to facilitate the border crossing experience.

The CAT Program was originally a project under the Passenger Screening Program where the ROI was calculated to as -35%. The CAT Program does not intend on revisiting ROI at this stage of its ALF and will leverage the PSP ROI. Therefore, the ROI of -35% would indicate that O&M will likely decrease -- or external benefits increase -- such that 65% of the initial acquisition costs will be recovered and 35% of the initial acquisition cost will not be recovered. The program will not generate any additional ""return"" or cost savings, this is due to the fact that investment is in security, which typically has negative ROI, since the upfront costs are very high and security benefits are hard to monetize. The ROI was calculated in the following manner. The status quo assumptions were analyzed for year by year and overall cost information. The next step was to calculate the year by year and overall cost of the chosen scenario and its benefits. The deltas for the year over year comprise the incremental investment required for the scenario. Next, it is necessary to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of both the costs and the benefits of the scenarios. A discount rate is given in the OMB A11 guidance. Subtract the discounted cost from the benefit. Then lastly divide the subtracted value by the NPV of the cost to calculate the ROI. The major internal benefits are the ability to provide many of the largest airports with a variety of equipment and provide a large scope of threat detection by allowing the procurement of different detection classes. It would also help to speed the deployment of a variety emerging technologies to the largest of airports to provide coverage to a major percentage of the traveling public. It also demonstrates a more strategic approach to security and has the flexibility needed to accomplish the security system and respond to emergent threats. Lastly the investment isthe preferred way to meet program goals to: enhance and automate threat detection; further integrate technologies and processes; promote a positive passenger experience; and enhance collaboration with stakeholders. External benefits were figured by calculating that if the program was successful there would be no catastrophic terrorist incident during the year.
