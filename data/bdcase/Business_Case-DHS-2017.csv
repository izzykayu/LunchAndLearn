The benefits of investment in DAIP ease the burden on disaster survivors, improve service delivery and reduce duplicative costs by multiple agencies.  DAIP provides a central portal reducing the cost and technical barriers to participation for federal agencies; increasing the number and types of assistance available, streamlining delivery of services and improving internal controls. DAIP is enhancing government's mobile and SMS text message capabilities so disaster survivors can access disaster assistance information in a way most likely to be available to them immediately following a disaster when phone and power lines may be damaged. At the same time, this effort greatly reduces the cost burden to the government and increases services to capabilities to the survivors.

Contribution to Mission Delivery:
DAIP directly supports FEMA's core mission ... ensure that as a nation we ...build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards. DAIP supports DHS FEMA's efforts to comply with the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006.

VIS is the single source of eligibility verification for those seeking employment authorization or access to certain benefits in the US. 
 
E-Verify and SAVE are mandated by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA).  E-Verify is an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States. SAVE is a program that enables benefit-granting institutions, licensing bureaus, and other governmental agencies to determine an applicant's immigration status
VER MOD supports the DHS mission to Enforce and Administer our nation's immigration laws by strengthening the infrastructure for the E-Verify and SAVE programs.
 
The goal of VER MOD is to address the reliability, scalability and functionality challenges that currently impair efficient operations of the E-Verify and SAVE programs. Specifically, the goals are to address six identified capability gaps, decrease reliance on expensive manual verifications, increase system reliability, and expand capacity. The benefits of modernization will be streamlined business processes with reduced risks of identity fraud, data inaccuracies, and system misuse.
 
Failure to modernize will negatively impact the performance and quality of the E-Verify and SAVE programs, compromising DHS' ability to meet its mission to enforce and administer our nation's immigrations laws.
   
Primary users/customers include Employers and E-Verify Employer Agents using E-Verify to verify work eligibility of newly hired employees; Federal, state, and local agencies that administer benefits; and Verification Division employees and contractors charged with performing status verifications, identifying potential misuse of E-Verify or SAVE, and providing customer support.  In addition to users, VER MOD stakeholders include data partners such as the Social Security Administration and Department of State, Congress, immigrant advocacy groups, and employee rights organizations.",024-030,"3255 - Goal 3.1:  Strengthen and Effectively Administer the Immigration System","This investment in modernizing VER, an existing capability, will recover a majority of the acquisition costs both by significantly reducing operations and maintenance costs over the system lifecycle and by enabling the system to efficiently address the anticipated greater than 175% increase in verification workload expected over the planning horizon.  VER MOD will achieve these objectives by: Optimizing the effectiveness of VER operational staff using VIS and associated systems for verifications; by minimizing the need for additional staff to address anticipated verification workload growth; and by increasing system capacity in order to address expected verification workload growth.  VER's CBA assumes an aggregate Operational Improvement Factor (OIF) by year applied to the costs for addressing VER's workload during the sustainment phase that was derived from individual OIF's for each of the thirteen planned Modernization releases.  Each Modernization release's OIF was based on the extent to which it: streamlines and reengineers business processes; increases automation; simplifies and enhances system architecture; and adds additional technical and human centric capabilities that both decrease the manual workload associated with each verification and expand the capability of VER to address the anticipated increases in the volume of verifications. 

- Expand System Capacity: System capacity will be expanded to address the over 80 million queries per year and 200 thousand MOUs expected by 2027
- Streamline and Reengineer Business Processes: Streamlined and reengineered verification business processes will both increase verification accuracy and efficiency by reducing the need to use high touch non-automated processes and by increasing the accuracy and efficiency of manual verification processes.
- Reduce Data Entry: Employers will reduce the time spent on data entry due to the Mobile E-Verify application and photo-based text importing from Form I-9 to E-Verify. Improving the ease of use of E-Verify is an important aspect of increasing ease of adoption and improving customer satisfaction.

The TSA's mission is to protect the Nation's transportation systems. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) mission is to detect, deter, and defeat hostile acts targeting U.S. air carriers, airports, passengers, and crews. The purpose of the Mission Scheduling and Notification System (MSNS) is to provide mission-critical, operational information support for the FAMS. The goal of MSNS is to help ensure that the FAMS is able to execute its transportation safety mission easily and efficiently, while providing system flexibility and evolving capabilities to meet changing mission needs in the coming years. 
Some of the current benefits of MSNS include its specific contributions to the FAMS mission: 
1) It automatically determines allocation of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) to flights using Industry-leading planning and manpower allocation software which incorporates TSA's risk-based strategies, FAMS policies, and individual FAM limitations;
2) It automatically coordinates and communicates mission assignments with Operations, Field Offices, and FAM personnel;
3) It automatically reserves, changes, and cancels airline tickets; 
4) Its automatic reservation and ticketing causes less disruption to the airline industry over manual methods;
5) It automatically tracks mission execution and supports operational changes to previous plans;
6) It provides live fail-over, disaster recovery, and Continuity of Operations (COOP) capabilities to ensure FAMS mission-critical information is available annually 99.999% of the time, 24x7x365;
7) It facilitates a smaller and stronger security perimeter around operational information by reducing the number of people needed to accomplish tasks in the FAMS mission.
 
The key customers of MSNS are FAMS leadership, operations and the individual FAMs. Other stakeholders include the TSA Office of Information Technology (OIT), TSA and DHS leadership, the U.S. Congress, and the President of the United States. Other beneficiaries are U.S. air carriers, airplane passengers, airports, and U.S. citizens.

Based on a further 5 years of utility, using the MSNS system results in a net benefit of approximately 5*$30.7M = $153.5M which was calculated based on input from FAMS Flight Operations division.
In addition, the following qualitative benefits continue to be achieved through improved automation:
Each month, MSNS facilitates coordination of thousands of air marshal availability schedules. This greatly reduces the amount of time it takes to create FAM missions.
Each month, MSNS automatically communicates tens of thousands of mission assignments with FAMS field offices and air marshals. This dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to notify the workforce of their assigned FAM missions.
MSNS is now able to more efficiently and more cost effectively reserve and purchase tens of thousands of airline tickets for air marshals every month. This drastically reduces the amount of time it would take to perform this task manually.
On a 24x7 basis, MSNS is now able to more accurately track FAMS mission execution and facilitate live mission updates in response to a wide variety of emergent conditions in the global air transport system.  This improved tracking capability increases situational awareness of personnel at the FAMS Transportation Security Operations Center (TSOC). It also keeps them informed of the status of FAMS currently flying on missions at all times on a real-time basis, and in turn greatly increases the speed and frequency at which they receive flight status updates.",no,no,no,yes,171.128,13.597,13.597,13.622,2001,2020,"MSNS does not have an explicit presidential budget line item.","This program has been in O&M since 2005, and does not require EVMS.

Purpose: to deliver a capability to assess risk through leveraging intelligence data, criminal history and immigration status information in order to effectively identify persons known or suspected to pose a threat to transportation security. 
The primary goal is to protect the national transportation system, through identifying and prohibiting high risk persons from holding a hazardous materials endorsement (HME), identifying low risk persons as eligible to possess a HME, and minimizing misidentifications of individuals as potential threats.  Performance Goals: timeliness, accuracy and efficiency, completing the adjudication process within 30 days; YTD average is 99% within 30 days or less; fingerprint reject rate is less than 0.4%.

The return on investment from SF, therefore, is the strengthening of national security provided by the program's real-time name matching and vetting services from aircraft operators (AO).  SF adds value to the national security and counterterrorism mission by identifying high & low risk passengers in order to mitigate known and unknown threats to aviation security that AO could not perform.  SF benefits the traveling public, US Government agencies with equities (e.g., DHS, DOJ, CBP), and the aviation industry for its ability to designate passengers for standard screening, expedited screening, or prohibition from boarding a covered flight, as appropriate. Primary nongovernmental users are aircraft operators, who are required to submit passenger data to Secure Flight to identify passenger matches and generate an accurate boarding pass printing result. In addition, aircraft operators benefit through improved aviation security, streamlined redress processes, relief from watch list matching, timely and accurate matches and resolution, and government response coordination (including law enforcement).  SF works closely with industry, other agencies, and stakeholders to ensure compliance with the SF Final Rule, which became effective on December 29, 2008.  Since 11/23/10, SF has conducted watch-list matching for all covered aircraft operators with flights into, out of, and within the United States, as well as for covered US aircraft operator flights between two international points (Overflights). SF remains engaged with each covered aircraft operator to ensure they comply with the SF Final Rule.

These statutes require DHS to prevent individuals from entering a secure area of a vessel or facility unless the individual holds a transportation security card or is accompanied by another individual who holds a card.
Contribution to Mission Delivery or Agency Management Support Functions: In accordance with the DHS Functional Capabilities and Activities Catalog, Version 1.0, dated January 2013, the TWIC program supports the PREVENTING TERRORISM AND ENHANCING SECURITY. Mission and the Screening function as listed in the Capability Portfolio.  As of May 2014, more than 3.0 million workers applied for a TWIC.
Goals: The TWIC program provides a vital security measure to ensure that individuals who pose a security threat do not gain unescorted access to secure areas of the nation's maritime transportation industry. 
Current or Anticipated Benefits: TSA (1) positively verifies each applicant's claimed identity; (2) performs a security threat assessment on each applicant; and (3) produces and issues a TWIC card containing biometric and physical information for each applicant meeting the threat assessment eligibility requirements. The TWIC security threat assessment provides a terrorism/intelligence check, a criminal history records check, and an immigration check. TWICs are tamper-resistant biometric credentials. The TWIC program provides a tamper-resistant biometric credential in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Key Customers, Stakeholders, and other Beneficiaries: Workers who may be required to obtain a TWIC include facility employees, longshoremen, U.S. mariners, deckhands, long haul and drayage truck drivers, laborers, and other individuals requiring unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels. The TWIC program maintains an extensive outreach effort to an exceptionally diverse group of key stakeholders: Congress; American Association of Port Authorities; National Association of Waterfront Employers; American Trucking Association; American Waterways Operators; Offshore Marine Service Association; Passenger Vessel Association; Intermodal Association of North America; International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union and others.",024-024,"3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","To calculate ROI, the program did a cash flow analysis using the TWIC Funding History report published by the TSA CFO which has the history of funding for the program up to September 30, 2013.  ROI for the TWIC program is calculated as (Cash In - Cash Out)/Cash Out.  Cash In is derived from two sources, appropriated funding provided early in the program and fee revenue collected from transportation workers once the program reached operational capability.  Consequently, as of September 30, 2013, Cash In = (Appropriated funds ($87.800M) + Fees $269.293M) = $357.093M; Cash Out = $309.636M; therefore ROI = $357.093M-$309.636M/$309.636M = 15.3%.  The details for this method are included in the first tab of the TWIC Funding History report which is uploaded.
 
The program has been in Operations and Maintenance since October 2008. The program's external benefits include providing a biometric credential to over 3.0 million transportation workers as of May 31, 2014. TWIC is one part of the layered approach to port security and establishes a minimum, uniform, vetting and threat assessment requirements for mariners and port workers across the country.  The nationwide recognition of TWIC as the one common credential needed to allow a worker unescorted access to secure areas of facilities and vessels enables facility and vessel operators to verify the identity of individuals, including the use of biometrics-steps that were not feasible prior to TWIC implementation with potentially thousands of different facility-specific credentials.  The credential is being used in over 2500 MTSA-regulated maritime facilities and vessels nationwide.  Through the use of a universally accepted common access card, the TWIC system has eliminated the duplicative costs associated with redundant credentials and application processes, thereby reducing costs to the individual transportation worker.

The benefit of the investment is an added layer of security and contributes directly to TSA's mission of protecting the homeland and detecting potential threats to transportation infrastructure. In addition to contributing to the goals/objectives of the DHS QHSR Strategic Plan (DHS Strategic Goal 1.1: Preventing Terrorist Attacks and DHS Strategic Goal 1.3 Manage Risk to Critical Infrastructure). TVS was originally intended to conduct biographic matching of flight crew members that fly into, out of and over US airspace. Over time, the technology supporting the vetting or name-based background checks were leveraged to support the vetting of other transportation related populations regulated by TSA. To date, TVS's infrastructure conducts vetting for all individuals regulated under TSA's maritime, surface and aviation security programs.

The TIM Program mission is aligned and consistent with the overarching DHS and TSA mission, DHS Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security.  TIM System is supporting operations by reducing the probability of a successful terrorist attack on the transportation system by applying threat assessment methodologies intended to identify known or suspected terrorist threats working in or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system. TIM is being built and operated in the DHS datacenter cloud environment to be a fully integrated system utilizing service oriented architecture capable of providing more effective and efficient security threat assessments to all areas of the transportation sector including, surface, maritime and aviation areas.  Using Service Oriented Architecture in the cloud environment, TIM provides services to maritime and is being expanded to serve surface and aviation transportation programs.  TIM has become the infrastructure focal point for stakeholders including; Congress, FBI, State Department, Coast Guard, State & Local agencies, U.S. airports, U.S. ports, transportation employers & unions.  The goals are to improve customer service, one-stop shopping, person-centric view to enroll, once and use many, increase efficiency of security threat assessments and information sharing with federal, state & local and industry partners promoting secure operations, support fee-fairness and comparability between credentials for the millions of transportation workers; realize economies of scale; and operational efficiencies through integration of processes.  TIM customers (transportation workers and travelers) will benefit from the efficiencies and cost avoidance once TIM is fully implemented.  Workers experience improved service at a lower cost.  TIM is poised to be an Enterprise-level solution for Screening Coordination Office (SCO) Credentialing Framework Initiatives (CFI).  TIM is one of the first DHS programs to use DHS Data Center Cloud Services TIM is paving the way for new security and data sharing methodologies.  TIM enables agile responses to changing business conditions and operational requirements via engineered business processes, seamless information sharing services based on managed data (accurate, timely, trustable) with tuned IT performance..",024-025,"3262 - Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","TIM is a Performing Program.  Though not fully implemented yet, the TIM Program is already eliminating redundant business practices, processes, and achieves significant economies of scale benefits associated with a unifying business integration effort.  TIM enables support for external stakeholders such as Maritime, Surface, and Aviation transportation worker / traveler populations.
Internal benefits to TSA include cost and performance efficiencies that will be achieved by through streamlined business integration of now separate IT systems (TWIC, Consolidated Screening Gateway, Hazardous Materials Endorsement Threat Assessment Program, Crew Vetting, Alien Flight Student Program) functionality under TIM.  Additional internal benefits include enablement of information sharing across TSA / DHS.  The TIM system is being built in the cloud environment at the DHS datacenters, which will in turn result in significant cost avoidance will be realized in the future years when the system is in the O&M phase.  
External benefits to stakeholders include streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person centric.  TIM is a person centric system that recognizes workers applying for multiple credentials, endorsements, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation or commercial modes.  This comparability capability enables TSA to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities and saves users time and money.    
The STA process uses the biometric and biographic information to conduct an automated immigration check, a criminal history check and finger print check, and a terrorist watch list check.  The approved STA is required for the worker to start/continue work or to apply for a job, any significant delays impact the worker and may impact commerce.

The same holds true for the aviation builds in FY15.  With completion in FY2016 of FOC, the TSA TIM program completes development and is in full operation across the transportation mode populations.","The TIM system development contract requires EVM.  An EVM IPT is actively reviewing monthly TIM Cost Performance Reports (CPR) and monthly contractor Program Management Review (PMR) documentation.  In addition the TIM Integrated Management Schedule (IMS) is reviewed to assess impacts on the critical path.  An Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) is developed and maintained as an integral part of the program's Earned Value Management (EVM) System. The IMS includes all activities, resources, and timelines in support of the program. The IMS is a set of separate schedules representing the work of contractors and government staff, networked together through external links. 
Many of the other smaller contracts do not require EVM because of the contract type.  The majority of contracts are Firm Fixed Price.
EVM is not a requirement for any of the other contracts or task orders above; however the TIM EVM IPT meets weekly on a monthly cycle conducting reviews of the Design and Development contractor, Accenture, progress management deliverables: Weekly Status Report, Contract Funds Status Report (CFSR), Cost Performance Reporting (CPR), Program Management Review (PMR), and the associated Integrated Management Schedule (IMS).  The TIM EVM IPT provides performance oversight and management of systems engineering, systems integration, interface activities, and transition to identify cost and/or schedule overruns and to provide a forecast of final cost and schedule outcomes.   Since the IBR held in December 2012, the iterative development of providing streamlined vetting and credentialing services that are timely and person centric has been measured and analyzed to ensure it provides major trending information to the Program Manager for use in decision-making.  
TIM is now completing migration of Maritime, the TWIC population.  Currently both cumulative CPI and SPI are very close to 1 and the EAC is within budget.  The TIM EVM IPT adheres to EVM standard which require that EVM integrates the technical performance requirements with the elements of cost and schedule.  Each incremental population / set of populations in the Surface and Aviation transportation modes will have an IBR and integrate the statement of work, schedule, and cost to create an aggregate picture of performance, which helps ensure that day-to-day decisions on performance for development efforts are consistent with program objectives.",2,"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program is an investment in the Obtain life cycle phase.

The primary goal of the investment is to support the systems that enable TSA to regulate the activities of Air Carriers and Indirect Air Carriers (IACs), regulate and approve companies to conduct screening operations, and determine the identity, validity, and risk of companies shipping goods on passenger aircraft.  The investment supports QHSR Mission 1: Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security and Mission 2: Secure and Manage Our Borders. The investment consists of three major systems, IACMS, KSMS, and FAS, and two minor systems, STAT and DAT, that serve to capture and manage data that help TSA mitigate the risk of terrorist incidents with impact on security operations (domestic and international). IACMS manages the IAC certification and renewal process, ensuring IACs implement security programs that reduce the risk of terrorism.  IACMS also enables IACs to obtain Security Threat Assessments (STAs) for their employees and agents, vetting individuals to reduce the threat of insiders introducing explosive or incendiary devices into commerce. KSMS vets shippers, reducing the likelihood that a shipper would introduce such a device.  FAS provides historical domestic and foreign air cargo screening data and is used by the TSA Cargo Targeting Unit (CTU) to manage time-sensitive data requests and identify high risk ports and entities via reliable risk data.

Primary benefits of this investment include improved oversight of regulated parties and shared security data (reducing costs and improving efficiency). By enhancing agent access to IACMS, deploying web services via KSMS, and automating manual processes via FAS, primary benefits include decreased time required for the vetting process, decreased transaction costs and processing times, decreased workload during the vetting process, increased data quality, and a reduction in the compliance burden by industry. Key internal stakeholders, customers, and beneficiaries include the Consolidated Screening Gateway (CSG), Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) Office, TSA Cargo Inspectors, and Principal Security Inspectors (previously known as Regional Compliance Coordinators).

As noted in the Air Cargo Final Rule (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-08-18/pdf/2011-20840.pdf) the main benefit of this approach is the improved security of the traveling public through reduction in the risk of an explosive or incendiary device being placed on an aircraft from the passenger air cargo mode, and an overall decrease in the risk of terrorism. It is difficult to determine how many planes would be destroyed by terrorism absent of the Air Cargo Security Program's approach; however, the program can conservatively assume that its systems can help prevent a terrorist incident on 1 flight per year, saving 0.00000012% (1 flight/8,315,000 domestic flights in 2013 according to transtats.bts.gov) of the nation's annual domestic flights from potential acts of terrorism. As a part of the final rule, TSA also estimated the cost of a terrorist incident to be $732.5M per incident. Air Cargo estimates the potential total cost avoidance to be $5.856B (1 incident x 8  years (total lifecycle) x $732.5M) and the program's total cost avoidance to be $585.6M (conservatively allocating 10% of this total cost, as the program plays a portion of the nation's layered approach to aviation security). Therefore the program calculates its return on investment (ROI) to be 1.31 ((Cost Avoidance/Risk Adjusted Total Lifecycle Cost of Program) -1).

ACE will deliver these capabilities in a secure, paper-free, web environment. ACE will fulfill Executive Order 13659, which mandates the creation of a Single Window, known as the International Trade Data System (ITDS), by December 2016.  ACE is the system through which the Single Window will be realized.  ACE/ITDS will be the primary means by which agencies with trade-related responsibilities will receive from users the standard set of data and other relevant documentation required for the release of imported cargo and the clearance of cargo for export. These capabilities/mandates fall in line with the DHS mission of Securing and Managing our Borders.

A key goal of ACE is to replace two aging and expensive legacy systems, the Automated Commercial System (ACS) and the Automated Export System (AES). AES has already been successfully retired and it's functionality subsumed by ACE in 2014. ACS will be retired by March 2017. Building ACS functionality into ACE will decrease O&M costs due to ACS retirement.

ACE's key stakeholders are; CBP, Partner Government Agency (PGA) users, and Trade. CBP includes border and trade enforcement personnel who use ACE to process shipments arriving into the US. Trade includes commercial entities that import, ship, insure and provide brokerage services to those importing goods into the US. PGAs include 47 government agencies responsible for the licensing and admissibility of cargo into the U.S.

ACE provides considerable benefits to its stakeholders; such as enhanced targeting of high-risk shipments, automation enabling CBP to process cargo faster (such as reduced primary processing time, which resulted in a savings of $5.4 million) and focus on border security tasks, improved, timely inter-agency information sharing, analysis, and investigation, more efficient workflow and reduction of costly labor and paper intensive activities (such as cost savings to the trade due to reduced border wait times, which resulted in a savings of $15 million in 2014), better reports and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations for Government and private sector, better compliance with legislation requiring greater Government efficiency and effectiveness to better serve the public.",024-043,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","The following is the explanation on ROI as stated in the attached AoA document: 
 
The Return On Investment (ROI) indicates the percent saved in future O&M dollars for every dollar spent on the initial investment. ROI is based on O&M savings in the following areas:  
 -          Help desk support -Application, hardware and software maintenance - 
 -          Data center labor - 
 -          User Training and Materials -Security Testing  
 -          Operational analyses due to lower usage of the mainframe platform  
 -          Efficiencies from the CBP target architecture  
 -          Reduced licensing costs  
 -          Shared system components  
 -          Standardizing certification and accreditation  
 -          Improving scalability and reliability and instituting open standards.  
The benefits of modernizing to a more efficient electronic interface will enhance communications between CBP, PGAs, and the Trade Community. The improved communications will provide time savings for entry corrections and allow for more timely cargo processing. For example, the Document Imaging System (DIS) will enable paper forms to be received and processed electronically, providing more efficiency at the Port of Entry (POE) and saving time and money for the government and the Trade Community.

These capabilities have been leveraged and integrated to expand the capabilities to inbound pedestrian, outbound vehicle and pedestrian, and Border Patrol (BP) checkpoint processing; and improve existing primary processing operations.

LBI's goals are to facilitate the flow of travelers into the U.S. in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to Secure and Manage Flows of People and Goods while minimizing disruption and facilitating safe and secure inbound and outbound legal flows of people and goods; increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of land border processing; and integrate data to support intelligence and targeting within the Land Border ""Triangle : inbound, checkpoint, and outbound.

Benefits include: vehicle (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without LBI technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes; reduced manual plate corrections and fewer time and labor intensive secondary referrals. The reduced number of acceptable documents, and increased document security features make it easier for officers to identify fraudulent documents.  LBI extended benefits from initial inbound vehicle capabilities by ensuring that vehicle and document data can also be acquired when vehicles leave the U.S. (outbound) or travel within the U.S. interior (Border Patrol checkpoints).  LBI has also extended these benefits to travelers entering the U.S. on foot (pedestrians) and buses.

Key LBI customers include CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and the traveling public.  LBI stakeholders include CBP officers and agents, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State,Mexico and Canada.

The beneficiaries are the traveling public and the governments of Canada, and Mexico and their citizens.

For inbound vehicle and pedestrian processing, RFID technologies, upgraded LPRs, an improved primary inspection application, direction variable message signage, traffic management devices, and policies like active lane management (ALM) expedite border crossing, more efficiently use scarce officer and infrastructure resources.  For example, the promotion of RFID technology and new RFID document options result in more efficient processing methods: vehicles (20%) and pedestrian inspection processing (35%) faster than standard processing without the RFID technologies and 60% faster for vehicles in Dedicated Commuter Lanes.  The improved LPRs have reduced manual plate corrections by 10 million per year further reducing process time and improving security.  The benefits that accrue from the technical facilitation (RFID, LPR, VPC) of the crossing process are far reaching: increased throughput per officer, reduced border crossing wait time, and increased capacity to accommodate increases in border crossing volume.  Increased border crossing volume has a positive impact on the U.S. economy.  These capabilities also provide more enhanced information about travelers which improves border crossing security.  LBI 'returns' are calculated based on the difference in wait time prior to LBI compared to post LBI, and by estimating the value of that time for the traveling public.

The 3 phase implementation of SAP was completed in October of 2004. This effort was undertaken as a result of an analysis of legacy Customs Asset Management Processes and replaced numerous legacy financial, procurement, and property systems with a single, fully integrated solution.  SAP provides many benefits to CBP including: complete integration of business processes within one system, improved financial statement reporting and internal controls, reduced cycle-time, elimination of duplicate data entry, improved data accuracy, single system reporting, and enhanced analytical reporting. SAP ensures that CBP is in compliance with Federal Government standards and regulations for financial management systems. The system has dependencies to other CBP systems in the form of interfaces and data transfers that enable the accurate and complete recording of financial and associated transactions. Those systems include Concur Government Edition (CGE), Customs Overtime Scheduling System (COSS), and the CBP Automated Collection System (ACS) to name a few. SAP provides the financial, procurement, and asset tracking which allows CBP to accomplish its mission.  The SAP approach reduces functional gaps identified in past audits and raises performance to acceptable industry benchmarks.  The SAP Project is in a steady - state mode under the Investment Management Process. CBP is now state-of-the-art and has been identified as a leader in Financial Management by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  SAP supports QHSR Mission 2; Secure and Manage our Borders.  The SAP system must be maintained and supported so that CBP financial staff can meet their timelines and efficiency targets which help CBP to operate effectively.  Maintaining SAP will also help CBP continue receiving unqualified audit opinions.  The primary beneficiaries of the system include the over 6000 CBP field and headquarters role-based users as well as CBP and DHS management who utilize the data and information processed and reported on in SAP. Other stakeholders for the SAP program include the Office of Administration and the Office of Information Technology as co-sponsors of the program; as well as others who rely on accurate financial data from CBP.",000-000,"3241 - M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","SAP is an integrated enterprise-wide resource planning (ERP) system that replaced ten stove-piped, outdated, and underperforming mainframe systems that created audit findings of significant internal control weaknesses and were deemed insufficient and no longer suited to meeting data processing and reporting needs.  SAP adequately addresses the current business needs of CBP and the program performs efficiently and effectively for end users and management.  The elimination of duplicate entry and labor intensive manual processes in both asset and financial management have created significant cost savings.  The QPAM analysis in 1999 found that implementation of an ERP system would generate the following reductions in government labor related to asset and financial management:  Planning reduced by 38%, Budgeting by 8.6%, Acquisition by 27.4%, Pay and Expend by 50%, and Monitor and Control would be reduced by 46%.  
SAP continues to be a good investment for CBP and the federal government.  In FY2014 with over $12 billion in budgetary resources; CBP collected over $40 billion in revenue and managed $15.9 billion in assets.  As an integrated ERP system, SAP handles budget formulation and execution, acquisition through disposal of assets, integrated procurement processes including requisition through payment, as well as business intelligence reporting.

The information is then transmitted to CBP prior to departure. APIS's aligns to the QHSR 2.1 goal to Secure US Air, Land and Sea Boarders and Approaches. APIS reviews passengers and crew to identify possible terrorists or other high-risk individuals. This helps identify threats versus non threats. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, requires commercial air and sea carriers to electronically transmit arrival and departure manifests for each commercial vessel or aircraft prior to arrival at or departure from the US. This includes matching APIS flights to reconcile CBP Entrance and Clearance entries, identifying carrier transmission errors for penalty and mitigation, capturing legislatively mandated information at or before time of entry for all air passengers, and analytical support for air carrier performance.

The NII Program seeks to match the technology and equipment with the threat, conditions and requirements at, and between, domestic Ports of Entry (POE's) and U.S. facilities that process international mail. The benefits of the NII Program creates economic benefit to commerce by expediting the flow of goods through the inspection process to avoid costly time delays. An additional benefit is the manpower savings by using technology verses manual inspections, a workforce saving of approximately 9,000 additional CBP Officers.   This expedited inspection process saves the trade industry an estimated 0.5-percent to 1.5-percent increase to the cost of goods that would be created if manual inspections were performed.
  
The goal of the NII Program is to provide technologies that assist in minimizing risk to personnel at and between U.S. POE's without sacrificing the facilitation of legitimate trade and traffic. An additional goal is to maximize the number of contraband seizures and to purchase, test, and deploy LS/SS NII systems to achieve sufficient operating capability for detection of a wide range of contraband that is imported using a variety of smuggling methods in various conveyances while maintaining a 95 percent average operational availability of NII equipment.

The ROI estimated in the FY06-FY07 Analysis of Alternatives has been validated in subsequent years.  There might be a slight variation in the ROI over the past several years due to varying acquisition quantities but the benefits are the same, maintaining a stable ROI.  As the program changes scope, or is expanded or enhanced, a new/revised Alternatives Analysis will be conducted and a new ROI calculated. An analysis of inspection technology and protocols in FY11-FY12 showed large-scale technology conducts inspections in an average of 6.7% of the time required for manual inspections. In FY2014, 22.5 million cargo laden conveyances with a market value of $1.1 trillion entered the United States at POE's and their associated crossings and terminals. Of the 22.5 million cargo conveyances, NII examined 7.2 cargo trucks and sea containers, of these examinations, over 2.3 million inspections were for cargo truck and seaport containers using imaging technology. Without using NII technology the same number of exams would have required approximately 9,000 additional CBP Officers.   
  
Small-scale technology analysis shows similar efficiencies. The number of inspections per year and the cost for them was calculated for manual inspections and for technology use. The speed, accuracy, and cost of the inspections used in the ROI calculations also included the external benefits to commerce. This was measured in terms of the costs for waiting times. Inspection technology accelerates the movement of legitimate trade and travel by reducing the time to conduct cargo and commercial vehicle examination.   
  
The greatest qualitative benefits of using NII equipment are the reduced threats to life and property due to terrorism.

ATS uses intelligence info and technology to target suspect inbound and outbound shipments for exams and passengers for inspection. ATS allows CBP officers to focus their efforts on cargo shipments and passengers consistent with current threats. ATS standardizes names, addresses, ship names, and similar data so these data elements can be more easily associated with other business data to form a more complete picture of a passengers, import, or export in context with previous behavior of the parties involved. Every passenger and shipment processed through ATS is subject to a real-time risk evaluation. Risk assessment strategies are multi-tiered in their approach and are founded on complex statistical studies, data analyses, and rules based on knowledge engineering. ATS serves DHS Mission of Securing and Managing our Borders by targeting individuals and cargo that are potential threats to U.S. citizens and the public.  By completing its mission ATS helps streamline the flow of passengers and cargo into and out of the U.S. Targeting efforts have helped maintain a significant benefit to the public. ATS provides selectivity and target capability to support CBP inspection and enforcement activities. As volumes of data increase in people, cargo, and conveyances, officers require increasingly efficient access to more relevant real-time info on which to base critical admission decisions.  The ATS systems address data quality improvements to ensure efforts are focused on only those persons and cargo that present most probable threats to the homeland.  The beneficiaries and key customers of ATS are: CBP Officers and Analysts, the CBP National Targeting Center, CBP Office of Field Operations, CBP Office of International Trade, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Public. Stakeholders include: DHS/CBP (OFO and OIT). ATS utilizes information received from TECS, APIS, and other systems identified in the Enterprise Architecture tab. ATS analyzes over 17M transactions per day.  Total ATS passengers and cargo systems maintain 99% uptimes.  Additionally, ATS scans over 150 million Air, Ocean, Rail, Truck, and Auto shipments for potential threats.

ATS has no DME funding and has been operational since 2004. ATS assists agents at the National Targeting Center and agents in the field by providing risk data on passengers and cargo. Hotlists containing potential threats on cargo and passengers provide officers and agents valuable info for a potential action. This is an invaluable resource capability. ATS also continues to provide quality data by working with other government agencies to eliminate derogatory matches and potential threats that are deemed false positives. ATS data augmentation, model integration, query capabilities, user defined rule competency, and other functionality characteristics provide information that assists in better targeting efforts. 
 
ATS benefits can be described through the# of persons denied boarding pre-departure 3,149 from October 2014 - March 2015 and cargo that is not allowed into the U.S. Another example is the SAS model within ATS which captured over $69.747 million dollars (street value) worth of Cocaine, Heroin, Meth, and Marijuana from October 2014 - June 2015.

ICE has a separate but coordinated TECS Mod program. Each agency is modernizing and enhancing the parts of TECS that support their unique missions.

CBP TECS Mod supports the DHS and CBP missions by protecting the nation from the entry of dangerous or illegal people, ensuring efficient flow of lawful people crossing US borders and enabling effective decision making through rigorous screening of travelers to provide improved intelligence and information sharing. It has reduced the possibility of missing someone who should have been intercepted by data integration and search capabilities, improved access to person-centric information, allowed person data to be re-queried upon inspection at Air/Sea Primary and improved the effectiveness and efficiency of secondary inspections by sending data from the primary to the secondary application upon referral, ensuring integration from primary to secondary.  The forgoing directly addresses the provisions of sections 201 through 203 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.

Block 1 supports U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents and officers to effectively detect, identify, classify and resolve illegal incursions at the border. The goal of the Block 1 System is to provide USBP with the ability to detect, identify, and classify incursions at the border.
 
The Block 1 system provides improved safety benefits to the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) with better tactical advantages through: over watch capabilities which use geo-positioning information with visual verification of agent locations relative to threats; better geo-synchronization actions for risk reduction through the use of landmarks and terrain references on the COP; geo-spatial tracking; visual verification; real time information on specific threats; and increased visual coverage through the use of sensors.  
  
The system provides technological tools throughout CBP, but specifically allows Border Patrol to focus efforts in areas other than Tucson and AJO, Arizona. This provides flexibility in deploying resources and personnel throughout the central and eastern Arizona region. The system has improved situational awareness of illegal cross-border activity, leading to increased narcotic seizures and apprehensions of undocumented aliens. There were approximately 2,338 Apprehensions and approximately 152, 204 pounds of marijuana seizures from Mar 2014 to Mar 2015.

Moreover, prior to the Block 1 system deployment, USBP did not possess a capability to accurately determine the amount of illegal traffic in the area currently covered by the Block 1 system. The ROI calculation shows -90% for the expected useful life of the Block 1 system. 

Compared to the baseline operating costs from which the ROI was calculated (1 border patrol agent, per one mile of border in AZ, 24/7), the operating costs for Block 1 system are estimated to be considerably lower. ROI was calculated by (Operating Costs without Block 1 - Operating Costs with Block 1) divided by the Capital Investment costs, providing the same level of surveillance. The internal benefit of improved situational awareness on the Arizona border has increased USBP's ability to execute its mission elements and processes. These elements/processes include: predict, deter, detect, identify, classify, track, respond, and resolve. The Block 1 system integrates multiple sensor outputs into one COP and provides USBP with persistent coverage within the Block 1 sensor viewsheds (see definition - Supporting Comments). In addition, these sensors are able to provide USBP Agents with an increased visual coverage area and more opportunities for early identification and classification.

Benefits include mission efficiency and effectiveness, as well as Border Patrol safety. More specifically, the IFT system provides the Border Patrol the capability of continuously detecting Items of Interest (IoIs) from a tested range of 6.2 miles and identifying/classifying each from a tested range of 5 miles from each fixed tower within a Border Patrol Station's Area of Coverage (AoC), and provides the Common Operating Picture (COP) operator(s) at the Border Patrol Station Command and Control Center with near real-time video of operator-selected IoIs of sufficient quality to enable a trained operator to identify and classify the IoI. IoI data from one or more IFT units across the AoC will be shown geospatially on one or more COP workstations that also display the video of operator-selected IoIs. This will allow the COP operator to track and communicate the location and number of IoIs to Border Patrol Agents in the field, thus allowing the USBP to monitor an Area of Interest (AoI) with fewer agents and equipment resources.

ROI was calculated by (Operating Costs without IFT - Operating Costs with IFT) divided by the Capital Investment costs, providing the same level of surveillance. Ergo, the key benefit is that for a lower overall operating cost , the IFT system will provide the Border Patrol with a persistent surveillance capability, which will enable them to detect, identify, and track IoIs, thus enabling them to monitor an Area of Interest more efficiently and effectively.

This allows CBP to adjust the location of its surveillance capabilities to keep pace with the ever changing border threat. The MSC consists of the outfitting of trucks with an array of sophisticated radar and sensing devices that aids Border Patrol (BP) agents in the detection of illegal border crossings. The MSC is an integrated suite of sensor equipment attached to the flat skid cargo bed of a Government-furnished Ford F-450 truck, with an operator workstation located inside the truck cabin. 

The MSC goals are to increase the situational awareness of CBP by detecting, identifying, tracking, and classifying potential items of interest. These goals supports Mission 2 of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR): ""Secure and Manage our Borders"". More specifically, the MSC Program addresses Goal 2.1: ""Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches."" 

Benefits of the MSC include: 1) Identifying and tracking of numerous IOI's over a large area, the MSC allows for greater surveillance coverage then possible with an agent on foot. 2) Enhances BP Agent safety by providing advanced warning of not only the existence of IOI's but the nature of that threat including whether the individuals are armed. 3) The abilities of the MSC also allow for greater response coordination thereby improving the likelihood of a successful law enforcement resolution as well as officer safety. Radar capabilities are responsible for two significant benefits over a camera only system: advanced warning of the existence of IOIs, and can allow for tracking of numerous IOI's over a larger area.

Nonetheless, an ROI calculation was developed based on operating assumptions (i.e., status quo of an average of one Border Patrol agent per mile of border versus 12 full-time MSCs). The ROI is developed by calculating the Base Case Operations and Maintenance (O&M) minus the New Program O&M (plus other benefits) and then dividing the value by the Planning, Initial Capital, and Non-Recurring (i.e., new program non-O&M or new investment) costs and then subtracting 1. This calculates the value as a %. There is a high cost for the status quo, and the MSC system requires a relatively low capital investment, resulting in a high ROI. The purpose of the investment is to increase the probability of apprehension in an effort to reduce cross border crime. Internal benefits are the increased probability of detection which increases the costs of attempting to enter the U.S. illegally, thereby reducing the illicit flows and crimes associated with smuggling at and between the ports of entry in AZ.  U.S. border threats are opportunistic, adaptive and continuously probing to exploit any new or existing weaknesses observed, and they have near real-time situational awareness of USBP activities through the use of a vast network of scouts on both sides of the border. For some locations, MSC systems are more effective systems than fixed tower infrastructure. MSC systems, with their mobile capabilities, can respond to threats in multiple areas, and can be fielded in the areas with the highest threats.  A more mobile response capability allows more flexibility and adjustment to changes in IOI patterns. MSC systems can be used to augment existing systems or substitute for currently deployed technology temporarily non-operational. External benefits include benefits related to the deterrence effect of a deployed MSC.

This goal of this investment is to continue to operate and maintain the Northern Border Remote Video Surveillance System (NB RVSS) located in Buffalo, NY and Detroit, MI. The NB RVSS towers have expanded the coverage on the northern border where high threat areas exist. The NB RVSS supports the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review by specifically supporting the security mission to Secure and Manage Our Borders. The NB RVSS systems support the DHS mission to improve upon border security, to exclude terrorist threats, drug traffickers, and other threats to national security, economic security, and public safety. The goal of the NB RVSS program is to provide persistent ground and maritime surveillance needed by Border Patrol agents to effectively deter, detect, track, identify, classify, and respond to items of interest throughout the respective Area of Responsibility (AOR).  

The deployed system covers over 50 miles of maritime border with the RVSS capability. Operating and maintaining the NB RVSS towers provides the financial savings of not having to commit hundreds of agents to support the mission. The deployed systems serve as force multipliers enabling CBP officers to effectively monitor the vast and complex border.

3. The system is available for use and operating dependably 99% of the time.
To further define the basis for the ROI, an ROI document was developed and available upon request. Based on a value of 2,200 Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) and 4,000 miles of border there are an average of 0.55 agents per mile of border.  Note that not all of these agents are on the border providing surveillance.  They perform a variety of tasks. For the Base Case, we are assuming that persistent surveillance (i.e., 24 hours per day and 365 days per year) is required and consists of 0.55 agents per mile of border.  The value of 0.55 agents per mile as an average was selected even though multiple shifts are required and not all current agents provide surveillance support at all times.  That is, this section of the border is assumed to be more active and require more agents than the average stretch of border.  The border is assumed to be limited to the section along which the Northern Border RVSS project would operate (i.e., 50 miles).  One truck is assumed to be provided per every four agents for transportation to and from the Border Patrol Stations (BPSs).  An average round trip travel distance for each truck was assumed to be 80 miles per shift with 3 shifts per day.

Current and Anticipated Benefits: Increased situational awareness while leveraging the added range of cameras systems; and replacement of the current analog system with a more secure digital system.

Mission Delivery Contribution: The RVSS Upgrade Program supports both the DHS Strategic Goal 2.1: ""Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and CBP Strategic Goal 2: ""Advance Comprehensive Border Security and Management. This includes preventing the illegal entry of people, weapons, dangerous goods, and contraband, and protecting against cross-border threats to health, food, environment, and agriculture, while facilitating the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce, as well as preventing the illegal export of weapons, proceeds of crime, and other dangerous goods. The program will enhance the current mission through early detection of border incursions, through enhanced identification and classification of the threat, and the ability to track items of interest through a law enforcement resolution. The program will enhance agent and public safety through persistent surveillance in high enforcement areas.

Stakeholders: Internal Stakeholders include Office of Technology Innovation & Acquisition (OTIA), Office of Information and Technology (OIT), Office of Border Patrol (OBP), Office of Administration (OA); external stakeholders include US Department of Interior (DOI); National Park Services (NPS); US Fish and Wild Services (USFWS); US Department of Agriculture (USDA)/US Forest Service; private and public landowners and various other regulatory agencies.

Customers and Other Beneficiaries: CBP US Border Patrol Agents, Intelligence Research Specialists, Sector Enforcement Specialists, Supervisors and Joint Field Command and the Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison (OIIL). External Customers and beneficiaries include State and Local law enforcement; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); and the general public.",024-042,"3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","Return on Investment (ROI): The calculated ROI is 1092% but the tool will not allow an entry more than 1000%.

Therefore, Government implementation of a cost control system (i.e. Earned Value Management (EVM)) is not cost effective.  That said, the RVSS Upgrade program still tracks cost (i.e. monthly expenditures against plan, estimates at completion (EAC), estimates to completion (ETC), reviewing and approving change requests with cost, and measuring cost performance against the APB cost thresholds and objectives).

The RVSS Upgrade program awarded a Fixed-Price contract to General Dynamics (GDOS) who is actively replacing video surveillance equipment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.  Since a fixed price contract transfers cost and schedule risk to the vendor, it is not cost effective for the RVSS Upgrade program to pay increased overhead to support earned value management (EVM) reporting.  Therefore, EVM will not be implemented on this program.",4,"The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) is in the Mixed life cycle phase.

TARS provides surveillance data to the CBP Office of Air and Marine (OAM) Operations Center (AMOC). TARS is an aerostat-borne surveillance system that is utilized by CBP's Air & Marine branch as its primary tool to identify and track suspect targets. Radar information from TARS is distributed to multiple operations centers run by CBP, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and DOD. As a secondary mission, TARS supports the United States Northern Command's (USNORTHCOM's) and the United States Southern Command's (USSOUTHCOM's) air surveillance mission. In addition, TARS surveillance data also supports North American Aerospace Defense Command's (NORAD's) air sovereignty mission for the Continental United States (CONUS).

TARS' strategic goal is to support the DHS QHSR mission 2, Secure and Manage Our Borders. TARS also strives to assist CBP to consistently detect, identify and classify illegal entries and determine the level of threat involved. 

TARS' benefits include a unique look-down radar capability that allows CBP to detect aircraft that would not be detected through a ground based system due to its low altitude and/or terrain masking limitations. While operating at 10,000 feet, the TARS radar has been optimized to detect low (0 - 2,000 feet above sea level) and slow (0 - 1,000 knots) aircraft at a range of 200 nautical miles.

TARS' primary customers are CBP's Air Marine Operations Center (AMOC) and CBP's Caribbean Air Marine Operation Center (CAMOC). Other customers include: Eagle Pass South Border Patrol Station, USCG, USNORTHCOM/ USSOUTHCOM (Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S)) and NORAD (Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) and Eastern Air Defense Sector(EADS)).CBP Stakeholders include: Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition (which manages the program), Border Patrol, Office of Administration, Office of Information Technology, and Office of the Commissioner. Non-CBP stakeholders include: EADS/WADS, DHS HQ and S&T, JIATF South, FAA, USCG, and the Government of Mexico.

As a result, an AoA/CBA (including ROI) was not required. However, theoretically, TARS' ROI is primarily related to increased interdiction and seizure of contraband. CBP operators rely on TARS today, and likely will for the foreseeable future, to fulfill primary domain awareness missions and responsibilities along the southwest border.  
TARS consistently sources 80-90% of suspicious air tracks along the SWB logged at the Air & Marine Operations Center (AMOC), including ultralight and short-lander aircraft threats.

ADIS collects and maintains arrival/departure information on non-US citizens traveling to the US, and matches this information to a person, thereby creating a complete person-centric record of events compliant with visa admissibility and issuance provisions. ADIS benefits to the government and stakeholders include assistance in determining admissibility, law enforcement action, Visa approval/denial and Visa Waiver Program eligibility. The investment benefits users by matching travel events with changes in immigration status to provide an overstay status. Benefits also include support for anticipated immigration reform and expansion of biographic and biometric exit activities. ADIS looks at arrival and departure data collectively from multiple sources to determine whether a person departed the US on time or if they legally extended their immigration status. Overstays are divided into 2 categories: (1) in-country overstays (ICO), meaning an individual overstayed and is still thought to be in the US, and; (2) out-of-country overstays (OCO), meaning an individual left the country, but overstayed the period of admission before departing. Internal stakeholders to DHS are CBP, OBIM, ICE, USCIS, TSA, & USCG. External stakeholders include DOS and the intelligence community. Other beneficiaries include the intelligence community. ADIS incorporates data elements & transactions associated with CBP systems & other immigration systems to create & maintain complete histories on about 300M travelers & processes more than 2.6M transactions a day. ADIS services are growing in usage, includes a 24/7 help desk, and maintains system uptime at 98% or greater. ADIS enables DHS to comply with Congressional, legislative, operational, and executive mandates by helping to determine if foreign nationals have overstayed terms of admission; enhances homeland security by providing a cost-effective response to the entry-exit statutory mandate to determine whether foreign nationals are legally in the US. ADIS contributes to mission delivery of the DHS by directly supporting the missions of Securing the Borders & Enforcing and Administering Immigration Laws.",024-042,"3255 - Goal 3.1:  Strengthen and Effectively Administer the Immigration System, 3258 - Goal 2.1:  Secure U.S. Air, Land, and Sea Borders and Approaches","ADIS is an inherited system in operational steady state, and as such does not have an identified ""return on investment.

ADIS supports these missions, goals, and objectives by serving as the Department's primary provider of overstay status and biographic identity services. Continued investment in ADIS is beneficial as ADIS represents a comprehensive, integrated system to track entry to and exit from the US. Determining if foreign nationals have overstayed their terms of admission enhances homeland security; ADIS provides a cost-effective response to the entry-exit statutory mandate to determine whether foreign nationals are legally in the US. ADIS is presently the only system in the Federal government that collects and retains overstay data, and is a critical part of evaluating whether VWP countries remain eligible for visa waiver status as granted by DHS.

CBP Mobile goals are to procure and deploy mobile technology to frontline personnel in support of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Report (QHSR) strategic priority to secure U.S. air, land and sea borders and approaches and prevent terrorist attacks.  

Some benefits include: Vehicle environment - mobile devices have led directly to over 1000 successful CBP enforcement actions by OFO and OBP, including identification of subjects of NCIC warrants, and the interdiction of undocumented aliens, narcotics interdiction, unreported currency and weapons violations. Rail environment - mobile devices are used for on-board pre-inspection clearance for passengers and crewmembers.  Seaport environment - mobile devices are used to process passenger/crewmembers.  Cargo environment - Agriculture Specialists with mobile inspection processing capability have immediate access to the applications, databases and reference material which enable real-time query, processing and verification capability.  Outbound land environment mobile devices provide valuable intelligence, enhance partnerships and assist with firearms and currency outbound interdiction operations. CBP Mobile plans to extend similar benefits across all CBP operational components. 

The mission outcome is meeting the need to add mobility through the provision of technology which enables officers, agents and specialists to perform inspections of travelers and cargo, and identify and process undocumented aliens to improve security and enhance intelligence gathering in all locations.

Key CBP Mobile customers include CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, the traveling public and the trade community.

This program has no formal calculation of ROI. However, CBP Mobile Program benefits CBP/DHS' mission, close critical performance gap, and increase efficiency and reduce cost by providing mobile devices technology which enables officers, agents and specialists to perform inspections of travelers and cargo, and identify and process undocumented aliens to improve security and enhance intelligence gathering in all locations.
Expected benefits are: 
 -         Mobile devices will improve cargo processing (inbound and outbound) in all modes; mobile devices will revolutionize the cargo release and agricultural inspection processes in particular. 
 -         Mobile devices will have a positive effect on passenger processing and will greatly improve sea passenger/crew admissibility processing.  Streamlining passenger processing in all mission areas without compromising security, officer or traveler safety results elevated public confidence in CBP professionalism and effectiveness.  
 -         Mobile devices mean real-time information availability in field environments which  increases officer/agents' safety and ability to interdict criminals
 -         Mobile devices will have the greatest impact where port facilities and inspection areas cover wide geographic spaces that currently require CBP officers to cover considerable distances to reach fixed workstations to access or enter data.  Releasing travelers and cargo without having to return to a fixed location enables officers/agents/specialists to spend more time conducting inspections/examinations and results in reduced overtime requirements to complete paperwork.  
 -         Mobile devices will positively impact the trade community by facilitating and shortening the hold time on commodities entering the country.  Goods inspected and released to market in a shorter turnaround time will have a positive impact on the U.S. economy.

BSDP is a mission critical tool that CBP has relied on to sustain officer and agent safety, and integrity, while also ensuring border security within and around all LPOEs. 
     
The goal for BSDP is to achieve more efficient and effective use of CBP resources and personnel, improved operational controland situation awareness, increased contraband seizures, enhanced CBP personnel safety and security and reinforced CBP personnel integrity.

BSDP quantitative benefits include the cost avoidance for officers, agents or guards not needed to provide persistent surveillance at and around LPOEs on a 24/7/365 basis. The cost avoidance was estimated at $94M/year. Qualitative benefits include: increased CBP personnel safety at LPOEs, improved emergency response times at LPOEs, reinforced CBP personnel integrity, reduced risk of CBP exposure to unsubstantiated claims at LPOEs, reduced burden on the public due to more efficient processing at LPOEs, increased efficiency and effective use of CBP resources and personnel at LPOEs, increased contraband seizures at all LPOEs, increased border security and control, improved flow of legitimate trade/travel at all LPOEs, enhanced situational awareness at LPOEs, improved officer safety in and around LPOEs, enhances visibility into the security and operational integrity at LPOEs, remote monitoring capabilities for automated border crossings, surveillance recordings used for evidence to support prosecution of criminal activity and officer integrity investigations.

During the development of the 2014 Operational Analysis (OA), the BSDP CBA was updated and compared against the financial projection estimated in the 2004 CBA. In the original CBA, BSDP was expected to provide a ROI of 589% by the year 2011. Two updated Return on Investment (ROI) scenarios were developed for the 2014 OA and in both cases the original external benefits were EXCLUDED from the calculation leaving only internal the cost avoidance benefit (reduced need for additional officers or overtime pay). The external benefit from 2004 was based on the benefit of preventing a terrorist attack on the order of 9/11 which is extremely sensitive to the probability of occurrence. In the first case described in the OA (Case 1), the benefit calculation was applied against the projected deployment scale used in the 2004 analysis. The second case (Case 2) measures the ROI against the actual deployment that occurred providing a more realistic assessment of the benefits derived and ROI achieved. (actual LPOEs and other locations utilizing BSDP). In both of the 2014 OA scenarios, the same actual costs were applied to the calculation. The result of the ROI update using actual costs showed that between 2004- 2011 BSDP ROI resulted in 479% for Case 1 (original deployment plan), and 745% for Case 2 (today's actual deployment).

The IT and non-IT systems, services and equipment that compose BPES were formerly managed and implemented in smaller, discrete non-major programs, making it difficult to implement and deliver mission capability and plan for future development and modernization. In FY15, these programs were consolidated into BPES because of their direct support to the USBP mission and because of their technical and functional relationships.
BPES' objective is to help meet the DHS, CBP, and USBP mission of protecting the U.S. from various 21st century threats and adversaries by enabling capabilities that address challenges in data management, threat response, and resource support through the use of select technologies. 
Primary benefits of BPES are: 1) Improved Information Sharing and Management-enables the automatic collection, dissemination and analysis of critical asset and personnel data, improving USBP's situational awareness and risk-based decision making process. This data is used to make better informed resource decisions. 2) Improved System and Process Integration-supports new innovative approaches to exchanging information and the integration of USBP technology. These efforts help USBP develop efficient day-to-day processes for agents, and reduce operational costs by providing timely information across various CBP systems. 3) Rapid Response Ability-enables USBP to gain greater situational awareness (through ground/geospatial sensors along the border) to support rapid response in investigating potential threats.

It is a cost effective O&M IT investment that exceeds business owner expectations. As evidenced by the data below, the Direct Access investment continues to prove to be extremely beneficial for stakeholders both internal and external to USCG. The migration of each of the systems into Direct Access has resulted in over $4M in annual cost savings in terms of hardware, software, and administrative support. The system pays huge dividends by integrating all aspects of HR to allow for a true Talent Management System. Through integrating PeopleSoft's payroll system, Global Pay, lines of accounting controls have been greatly enhanced for Active Duty and Reserve personnel. It ensures improved and accurate lines of accounting in Direct Access, which has allowed USCG's Pay and Personnel Center (PPC) to discontinue two backend manual accounting processes.
 
External benefits have increased with this consolidation in that users can access a single payroll application in one place. Additionally, prior to Direct Access, the Service Personnel Office (SPO) had to process every individual leave transaction manually.  Through the functionality of Absence Requests, the number of requests to be manually processed by SPO was reduced by 260,000 annually. This translates into eliminating approximately 13,500 man-hours of data entry work, a total cost savings of $548,166 per year.

In Aug 1999, KDP2 authorized the program to proceed into the Capability Development and Demonstration phase. In Aug 2001, the Coast Guard awarded three R21 Phase I contracts to competing contractors to develop proposed system designs. The Phase I proposals were reviewed in late 2001 and the Phase II production contract RFP was issued in Feb 2002. Following a formal source selection process, the USCG's Source Selection Official (SSO) awarded the R21 Phase II production contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems in Sep 2002. In Jul 2005, DHS authorized the R21 program to proceed into the Production and Deployment phase and full rate production subsequently commenced in Sep 2005.

Internal Benefits: R21 is used to tailor CG response (including coordinating with local first responders and federal coordinators), significantly reducing response time to mariners in distress. The R21 system enhances the CG's ability to detect & respond to distress calls in the coastal zone, which directly benefits the U.S. public's marine safety & saves lives. Benefits also include system disaster recovery capabilities that have supported coordination in numerous federals regional response and remediation efforts by providing a critical communication backbone in the disaster regions. For example, the R21 system provided a communication system that supported efforts to re-open ports in NY and NJ after hurricane Sandy.

External Benefits of the R21 system: Provides capabilities to help ensure the successful outcome of Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. To date, R21 has been used in more than 79,000 SAR cases.

ALMIS is a centralized system that captures programmatic information that is used at all levels of the Coast Guard.
 
The goal is to align ourselves with the Commandant's direction to protect those on the sea and protect the nation from threats delivered by the sea and protect the sea itself by providing mission ready crews and assets and to support ALMIS users with system availability of 98% or better.  
 
ALMIS benefits our 22,000 customers and stakeholders by providing an electronic system which is reliable, ensures safe and mission ready assets, captures mission events accurately, is user friendly, and provides total asset status visibility.  ALMIS provides operational oversight capability for mission scheduling and execution. ALMIS benefits operational leadership by providing the tools to maintain OPCON/TACON oversight of our missions and assets. ALMIS directly supports our aviation and naval units to include 325 aircraft, 1,618 Small Boats, 166 Cutters and 109 DGPS Towers. ALMIS benefits also include the metrics and statistics to support HQ operational budgetary requirements.
 
ALMIS contributes to Coast Guard mission delivery by supporting data entry from the start of an operational mission, recording the mission execution and tracking crew competencies and proficiency. The system maintains aircraft and naval asset maintenance along with standardization, supply, part replacements, and warehouse activities in order to provide safe and mission ready assets.  ALMIS supports core financial procurement actions, and the reconciliation necessary for current business processes. ALMIS contributes to the four key components of the circle of logistics, which are: mission, configuration, maintenance, and supply.
 
The key customers of ALMIS are the Configuration Control Board (CCB) membership representing the logistics centers, operational leadership and those providing the actual asset logistics support.
 
Our major stakeholders include CG-4, CG-7 and C4IT-SC along with the logistics centers to include SFLC, SILC and ALC.

Return on Investment is a performance measure which evaluates the gain from investment divided by the cost.In our organization this return on investment is measured by meeting the key goals and missions of the Coast Guard which ALMIS directly supports.  
 
The benefits from aviation are reflected in the following highlights:  The Coast Guard responded to over 39,000 potential cases, benefiting the public by saving more than 3,00 lives in FY14.  Additionally there were over 6,000 sorties supporting Living Marine Resources, 3,300 sorties for Drug Interdiction and 1,900 Migrant Interdiction sorties that directly benefit all citizens. Coast Guard aviations' 325 aircraft and their crews played a significant part in these accomplishments.  ALC's unwavering air station support ensured the operational unit readiness, measured by operational availability met the needs of the public.  The benefit of Coast Guard mission success is the result of key operational/engineering support and documentation systems which ALMIS provides.  ALMIS is the foundation for mission scheduling, asset permission and servicing, mission records, documentation of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, asset configuration, maintenance due lists to maintain all operational assets, key financial and supply support systems which when combined, keep our asset availability rate so high.  
 
ALC continues to add both vessels and aircraft into ALMIS and is becoming the asset status system of record for most of the Coast Guard.  In 2013, ALC added the large cutters into ALMIS, achieving total asset visibility. This benefited the SFLC by increasing visibility over fleet maintenance.  SFLC has enrolled 166 cutters into ALMIS.  ALMIS also benefits the surface fleet by providing reports for the status of over 1,618 small boats.

NAIS is a data collection, processing and distribution system that provides international Maritime Organization (IMO)-adopted Automatic Identification System (AIS) information to enhance safety of navigation and our Marine Transportation System (MTS), and improve Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The project provides the necessary capability to ensure the effective exchange of information  between AIS-equipped vessels, aircraft, ATON, and shore stations within all major U.S. ports, waterways, and coastal zones.  It integrates a network of AIS receivers and transmitters, data processing and storage centers, and user interface services that capture, exchange, and analyze data of critical interest for maritime safety and security.  Data collected supports the nation's maritime interest, from the safety of vessels and ports through collision avoidance, to the safety of the nation through detection, traffic identification, and classification of vessels.
Benefits/Stakeholders:
The data collected by NAIS will be shared with other pertinent stakeholders and decision makers in support of maritime security at critical ports.  NAIS supports a layered defense and requirements for Advanced Notice of Arrival by correlating AIS data with target vessel reporting and other maritime awareness data to focus resources on higher interest vessels.  The key customers and primary beneficiaries of NAIS include: USCG, CBP, Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, IRS, indirectly to the international community through MSSIS, and port partners.  Maritime Operational Threat Response benefits in achieving a coordinated U.S. Government response to threats to the US in the maritime domain.  NAIS will facilitate the Coast Guard response to threats in the maritime domain by enabling better visibility of suspect vessels as well as other vessels in the vicinity.  NAIS will allow for visibility and tracking of U.S. Government vessel assets for improved overall coordination of resources.  Maritime Communications benefits are associated with improved USCG ability to communicate with vessels in support of various USCG missions.  These benefits include the enhanced exchange of navigation information, improved communications interoperability with foreign vessels and other Government agencies' vessels, and backup capability to the Rescue 21 voice systems via AIS messaging.

The ROI of 7.94, as calculated in the NAIS Alternatives Analysis of Dec 29, 2006, was calculated by determining the sum of the present value of all benefits and dividing it by the sum of the present value of all costs of each capability.  The benefits of security risk reduction (such as detection of large commercial vessel introduces WMD into US port and fishing vessel has a crew member onboard suspected of being a terrorist) are included in the ROI calculation.  The benefits of operational performance (such as improved Search and Rescue detection and response and collision detection and enforcement) have not been included because the confidence in those calculations was low; however if they were to be included, the ROI would be even higher.  The benefits were calculated for the following capabilities provided by NAIS: coastal receive, coastal transmit, long range receive, advanced data capability, and inland waters receive and transmit.  For each capability a variety of scenarios were evaluated using probabilities of occurrence and consequence costs to demonstrate the improvement in security risk by implementing NAIS.

The tech refresh of VLS, currently in the implementation phase, will enable the VLS to support modernized business processes for the CG surface logistics community, while affording the opportunity to improve data quality in the transition. VLS continues to provide a suite of logistics tools for the surface community that is evolving to support modernized Coast Guard business processes, on a new IT foundation that supports modular development, and from a suite with only half the number of applications, which drives down indirect costs of the program. This, in turn, will better support the Coast Guard while VLS is operational, and also during the transition to CG-LIMS. Components of VLS have been in operation for almost 20 years.  Initial ROI for VLS was realized well before the 7 year mark.  
The VLS tech refresh is expected to be completed by the end of 4th Qtr FY15.  After the completion of the project and staffing is at final allocation, return on investment will be realized in 2.5 years. Savings will be realized in certification and accreditation (due to only two systems requiring C&A after the refresh. The refresh also eliminates dependency and licensing costs on an enterprise CG VPN solution, but the primary benefit of is the elimination of dependencies in VLS on an obsolete and unsupportable database and technologies. Additional benefits include a vastly improved ability to support Coast Guard modernized business processes, and the ability to do frequent small improvements in the future (modular development). 
Technical benefits of the refresh include: (1) Moving the application and relational database management system to a modern, supportable development platform based upon technologies commonly supported at Coast Guard Operations Systems Center (OSC) and included in the Technology Reference Model. (2) Use of OSC SOA/ESB capability to deliver data to and from current and envisioned application entities.

The program acquires and implements the C4ISR capabilities mandated by the ORD to improve the USCG response to emerging threats and hazards within the maritime domain. C4ISR mission needs, threats and gaps described in the 2004 Deepwater Mission Need Statement (MNS) were validated in a 2009 C4ISR MNS and remain valid. C4ISR concerns extend beyond deepwater regions to wherever Coast Guard assets are relied upon to support the service's enduring roles of Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship. To effectively respond to the threats facing our maritime region, the C4ISR modernization program will focus on the following priorities: Functionality: Obtain core C4ISR for air, surface, intelligence and shore; Interoperability: Transition from proprietary to government to open solutions; Implementation: Net-centric design, initial asset installs and upgrades and back-fits; Supportability: Lab infrastructure that supports the Government's role as system integrator and keeps pace with constantly evolving information technology demands and standard changes; Sustainment: Technology development and upgrades that reduce O&M costs. 

Stakeholders include DHS, DoD, CG operators, Sponsor (CG-7), and Technical Authority (CG-6). 

The program has completed delivery of baseline C4ISR capability (Increment 1), as well as the federated CGC2 baseline (Segment 2), to 25 aviation assets (8 LRS, 17 MRS).

CG-LIMS supports the USCG Modernization goal of a single, unified logistics system that improves mission-readiness, operational effectiveness, and decision-making by enabling decision support at the enterprise and tactical level. CG-LIMS uses the Mission Support Business Model and the 4 cornerstones of that model: Configuration Management, Total Asset Visibility, Bi-Level Maintenance, and a single point of accountability through Product Line Managers. It will be the authoritative source for the configuration management of USCG assets, enabling product line management by providing total asset visibility throughout the enterprise. It will be the tool through which all maintenance is managed, and by which the enterprise supply chain is driven. The components of configuration management, maintenance management, supply chain management, and technical information management will be integrated and configured to allow efficient execution of a standardized business process. 

LIMS will achieve significant savings in CG's annual operating expenses for assets and increase the time those assets can be at sea and in air by integrating the support processes and capabilities to improve operational effectiveness and reduce total ownership costs for air, surface, vessel and Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information Technology (C4IT) platforms; and is intended to be the enterprise asset management system for the CG.

Through the replacement of many existing, resource-intensive logistics systems with one centrally-managed, integrated system, CG-LIMS provides significant cost savings in the IT application alone.  
The system has the ability to fully trace financial obligations, asset valuations, and overall CFO Act and FFMIA compliance which is a high priority for the Coast Guard. An integrated, centrally-managed logistics system, properly integrated with the Core Accounting System at the transaction level of detail, enables accountable tracking of financial transactions throughout the organization, in lieu of the current stove-piped processes that make the task manpower-intensive and overwhelming.  
Current legacy logistics IT investments in the Coast Guard will be targeted for consolidation and replacement by CG-LIMS. Capability required for each stove-piped community will be fully considered in the requirements phase of this investment.   
The Coast Guard's financial transformation and progress toward compliance with the CFO Act and FFMIA is enhanced by the transparency of logistics systems and ability to interface with relevant information managed within them. Investing in a centrally-managed, integrated logistics system allows the Coast Guard to provide timely and consistent data to the Coast Guard's Core Accounting System.

Goals:   
* Collaborate with port partners for joint planning and operations through risk-based assignment of resources to mission demands; 
* Share targeting, intelligence and scheduling information to improve situational awareness, uncover gaps in planned and ongoing operations, and reduce duplication of effort between agencies; 
* Allow Coast Guard command centers to develop real-time awareness, evaluate threats and deploy finite resources to the right places through active collection of port activity information; and
* Minimize the economic impact from any disruption, whether natural or manmade.

PAWSS is a part of the Vessel Traffic Services program, and is one of several systems used for this program. The PAWSS was Congressionally Mandated to modernize Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) in five ports (New York (NY). Houston/Galveston (HG), San Francisco (SF), Prince William Sound (PWS), and Puget Sound (PS)) and introduce automated VTS systems in four other ports (Lower Mississippi River (LMR), Sault Ste. Marie (SSM) Berwick Bay (BB), and Port Arthur (PA)) through the use of commercially available technology including Automatic Identification System (AIS), Radars, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV), and voice communications.

Benefits
 
PAWSS is a Vessel Traffic Service navigation information system that is based on commercial off-the-shelf products consisting of sensors, communications, and decision support equipment. PAWSS automates several processes for the Vessel Traffic Services Program and allows watchstanders to focus more on evaluating the traffic picture. PAWSS is deployed in a number of coastal locations throughout the U.S. and allows the Coast Guard to propagate important navigation information to mariners, thereby reducing collisions, groundings, and facilitates the safe and efficient transit of vessel traffic. The system compresses radar, VHF-FM voice, AIS, and video from remote sites into commercial leased landlines or microwaves and sends the information to a central VTS (Vessel Traffic Center). The vessel data is processed and displayed in a graphical interface, chart based format that leads itself to early recognition of potentially dangerous situations. A minimum of twelve months of vessel transit data is stored in an Oracle database for later reconstructing collisions, spills or other incidences. Additionally, the historical data facilitates data mining to analyze potential trends, such as, traffic density, port tonnage and fulfilling Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. PAWSS utilizes Commercial off the Shelf (COTS)software and hardware. The core component of the PAWSS is based upon the proprietary Lockheed Martin MTM-200 Software Architecture.

The goal is to provide an affordable, standard, an approved network at the Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) level. The network will provide a means for mission critical data exchange between Coast Guard members, contractors, port partners and other federal/states agencies that work with the Coast Guard.  The network is a critical tool used by the Coast Guard to communicate and achieve success in Maritime Safety, Security and Stewardship.  
 
Benefits: Currently, CG One meets DHS mandates to use one network under DHS in order to improve management and security of the network.  The Coast Guard uses the network services provided by DHS under the Infrastructure Transformation Program (ITP) Working Capital Fund (WCF).  This solution allows the Coast Guard to meet requirements for department-wide information sharing and to consolidate its Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) networks into one department-wide network called OneNet; while sustaining the ability to connect with DOD computer networks (NIPRNET). The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency is responsible for DHS's OneNet network infrastructure under the ITP plan.

NCPS consists of the hardware, software, supporting processes, training, and services that are being developed and acquired to support the Department's mission requirements as delineated in the CNCI and mandated in NSPD-54/ HSPD-23.  NCPS provides a wide range of cyber security capabilities for the Federal Executive Branch government networks (.gov domain), including:  intrusion detection (passive defense); intrusion prevention (active defense); advanced cyber analytics - such as data aggregation & correlation, visualization, malware analysis, and packet capture; incident management; and information sharing and collaboration. NCPS aligns with three missions in the 2014 DHS QHSR: 1. Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security; 4. Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace; and 5. Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience. NCPS contributes to Terrorism Prevention as cyber-terrorism becomes intertwined with cybercrime and state-sponsored activity. NCPS also supports efforts to strengthen and safeguard national infrastructure. NCPS aligns most directly with the Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace mission, and it supports all four goals of the 2014 QHSR: 4.1 Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure; 4.2 Secure the Federal Civilian Government Information Technology Enterprise; 4.3 Advance Law Enforcement, Incident Response, and Reporting Capabilities, and 4.4 Strengthen the Ecosystem.

Under this program, DHS centrally oversees the procurement and operations of diagnostic sensors (tools) and dashboards deployed to each participating agency. Using input from the sensors and agency-level dashboards, officials at each agency will be able to quickly identify which network problems to fix first, and empower technical managers to prioritize and mitigate risks on their respective networks. In addition, DHS will maintain a dashboard to provide situational awareness on a federal level. For those agencies that require additional support, contractors have been approved by GSA on behalf of DHS to provide Continuous Monitoring as a Service (CMaaS) to support CDM integration. 

This initiative directly respondsto three key pieces of policy guidance for DHS and its role in federal network security. First, it supports DHS Mission Four, ""Safeguarding and Securing Cyberspace. Secondly, it is in direct support of the Administration's 2015 Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal for implementing continuous monitoring across the federal network space. Finally, it supports OMB-14-03 which mandates agencies to use the CDM/CMaaS BPA as contract terms expire for information security continuous monitoring systems, and suggests that agencies leverage the DHS CDM program. 

DHS will be better prepared to fulfill these goals with the implementation of the federal-level dashboard. The dashboard will include summary data to allow DHS to assess the level of risk by agency.

The ROI reflected in the AA section of the Exhibit 300 is reflective of the Solution Engineering Analysis. Within the AA, there was an assumption that since mitigation was not included within the investment, there could be no claim of removal of threat. However, the solution engineering analysis determined that the best approach would be an ROI calculated based on the potential mitigation of known threats and vulnerabilities. The ROI is based solely upon benefits/investment of Increment 1 since Increments 2 and 3 are not currently defined well enough to determine benefits. ROI is calculated as Rate of Return = (Gain of Investment/ Cost of Investment) - 1.
 
Three sources were used to calculate the benefits of mitigation activities. Method 1 - Cost Per Attack; Method 2 - Ponemon Institute/HP Study 2011; Method 3 - Banking Article. These three sources are all comparable, calculating the same benefits. The three sources were averaged because it is unknown which source would represent a more realistic scenario to the federal government. The true benefits could lie anywhere within the range shown in these calculations.
 
As stated above, these three methods were averaged. The average benefit would be approximately $0.9B in BY13$. Then, to calculate the ROI, to the $0.9B, the difference in O&M costs from the baseline were added, and then that result was divided by the Investment + PMO costs for Increment 1 would be the following:

LSCMS provides FEMA with the flexibility to respond to and recover from all hazards as well as provide full disaster supply chain visibility to FEMA and its partners.  Specifically, the goals of LSCMS include the ability to:

 - Manage the entire supply chain, including FEMA-owned assets and resources as well as those provided by partners in other federal agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
 - Ensure the right resources/commodities are available at the right place and time 
 - Divert resources/commodities based on changing demand
 - Know the location and status of capital assets, commodities, and all other resources in real time
 - See inventory at all distribution nodes (e.g. Distribution Centers (DCs), Incident Support Bases (ISBs), Mobile Housing Unit (MHU) sites, and material delivered to state staging areas and local Points of Distribution (PODs)
 - Integrate with the supply chains of partners in federal government agencies, and other Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) and non-ESF federal agencies, NGOs, and logistics service vendors
 - Share supply chain data with state/local/tribal governments
 - Provide a resource that all FEMA strategic partners can use to support transparent and fully coordinated end-to-end disaster response
 - Provide supply chain visibility to all stakeholders
 - Scale resources to meet requirements

Stakeholders of LSCMS include DHS/FEMA senior leadership, FEMA logistics management, FEMA regional management, FEMA IT (e.g., EA and Security), and other FEMA Divisions (e.g., National Preparedness, Disaster Assistance, Disaster Operations), State/local/tribal government, Emergency Support Function agencies, vendors/suppliers/carriers/logistics providers, oversight bodies (including Congress, OMB, GAO, OIG), and media.  Direct customers are FEMA HQ and regions, ESF partners, and state emergency managers and responders.

An analysis of gaps to current requirements, a limited analysis of alternatives (AoA) to address the gaps, and an operational benchmarking similar to other logistics operations is to be performed. The LSCMS Program Office worked with DHS to obtain AoA contractor expertise from MITRE - timeframe to complete the AoA Study Plan is 11/20/14 and the Limited AoA by 11/30/15.
 
Annual LSCMS acquisition costs vary, O&M costs change as development components are implemented and public benefits, disaster frequency and severity are unpredictable. The ROI formula has too many unpredictable components to be calculated precisely, but an ROI qualitative analysis is useful:
ROI=(((Original Baseline O&M - New Total O&M) + Other Benefits to Society)/Acquisition Cost Only)-1
   
The LSCMS ROI calculation considers the benefit to the public of using LSCMS compared to alternative uses of the funds. However, public benefits directly attributable to LSCMS are dependent on disasters making actual benefits unpredictable. An expected yearly benefit over the cost of not implementing LSCMS is estimated at $5M, including savings, cost avoidance, and productivity improvements. This does not consider the benefit of implementing LSCMS. An average annual public benefit of $20M, based on 4 disasters per year and $5M per disaster for benefits to the states = $20M, returning an annual benefit to recover the initial investment by 2024 (or earlier if public benefits accrue faster.)
   
Although a quantified ROI timeframe is not feasible, the ROI is negative when considering only system benefits which are always less than O&M costs, and significantly positive when considering the probability of annually distributing more than $20M in ""benefits to society. 
 - Previous O&M = averaged $29.85M
 - New O&M = $24.88M
With increasing resource costs, O&M costs are not anticipated to decrease.
 - System cost Benefits = $5M
