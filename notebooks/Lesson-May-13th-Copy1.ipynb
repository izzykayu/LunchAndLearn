       " 'BriefSummary': \"The purpose of SEVIS is to fulfill a legislative mandate to electronically collect certain information from approved schools and exchange programs on nonimmigrant students, exchange visitors, and their dependents. The goal of SEVIS is to track information on nonimmigrants who are participating in the U.S. education system or designated exchange visitor program throughout the duration of their approved stay. Nonimmigrants may temporarily come to the US to study under three classes of admission: F for academic and language students, M for vocational students, and J for exchange visitors. SEVIS greatly improved efficiencies by using electronic means to capture critical F/M/J nonimmigrant information in a centralized repository. The use of the SEVIS electronic system increases data accuracy, reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information, improves the experience of school/program officials and nonimmigrants, and significantly increases data sharing across multiple government agencies reducing duplication of effort. Efficiencies are further improved through the ability of the web-based SEVIS application to be used in real-time for data updates and queries which reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information. SEVIS supports the DHS Mission by providing critical information needed to enforce immigration laws. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) within the ICE Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is the business sponsor that funds and manages SEVIS. SEVIS also supports the Department of State (DoS) Office of Private Sector Exchange in its mission. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides IT program and project management support to SEVP. Stakeholders include DHS ICE and DoS government users; customers are users from the academia and programs sponsoring F, M, or J status nonimmigrants; nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors and their dependents. In addition, SEVIS shares data with agencies' and organizations' systems including, DoS Consular Consolidated Database (CCD), USCIS Electronic Immigration System (ELIS), Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF), Department of Treasury I-901 Fee Pay system, Student and Exchange Visitor Program Automated Management System (SEVPAMS), CBP TECS, Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS).\",\n",

       " 'ROIDescription': \"SEVIS is currently the only system designed to identify how many students and exchange visitors are in the United States, what they are doing, where they are located, whether they are participating in Optional Practical Training, or are Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics students.  Previously a paper based process, SEVIS implementation provided efficiencies by using electronic means to capture critical F/M/J nonimmigrant information in a centralized repository. The use of the SEVIS electronic system increases data accuracy, reduces the time needed to gather and distribute information, and improves the experience of school/program officials and nonimmigrants. SEVIS has continued to add value in the support phase. One of SEVP's missions is to strengthen the U.S. by building cross-cultural ties and attracting highly talented students and scholars. During the life of SEVIS, enhancements have been made to help facilitate the process required for foreign students and scholars coming to the United States and to minimize a perception that the United States is discouraging foreign students and scholars from coming to the U.S. These enhancements include ensuring that data is accurate so nonimmigrants are not denied a visa or entry based on incorrect information and ensuring that there are processes to quickly correct inaccurate data. Foreign student enrollment plateaued prior to and during the initial deployment of SEVIS. Between 2006 and 2012 the number of foreign students has doubled and continues to grow. Government users have also come to recognize the value of SEVIS data. A primary example is the timely data that SEVIS provides CBP, which supports CBP officers at U.S. ports of entry in making information-based decisions on granting entry for F, M, and J nonimmigrants. For the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF) and the ICE Compliance Enforcement Unit (CEU), SEVIS has similarly become an essential tool for national security.\",\n",

       " 'CIOEvaluationComments': 'The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) program is in the Support life cycle phase. Program leadership continues to capture, analyze, and develop mitigation strategies for likely risks in the current Risk Register. As of 3QFY15, the SEVIS program deployed SEVIS 6.20, Admissibility Indicator V1.4, and Performance Engineering 5. The releases position SEVIS to address action items specified in the February 2014 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) regarding system stabilization and vulnerability issues. Since the last assessment, the program has resolved 75% of the legacy system vulnerability issues. SEVIS is formulating an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to determine the solution set for closing the remaining vulnerabilities. Additionally, the AoA will also propose an alternative approach to support the SEVIS modernization initiative. The planned delivery of the AoA was scheduled for 1QFY16; however timeline has shifted with no update on delivery. The program continues to utilize Agile and Burn-Down charts for sprints resulting in high-quality cost estimates, which allows the program to maintain cost and schedule variance within OMB-acceptable range. The SEVIS Executive Steering Committee (ESC) continues to monitor program activities. An updated Operational Analysis scheduled for FY15 will address four key areas: customer results, innovation, strategic and business results and financial performance.   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Chief Information Officer (CIO) continues to assess the SEVIS program as a Moderately Low-Risk investment.',\n",

    "r = return_pred(s=\"The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) program is in the Support life cycle phase. Program leadership continues to capture, analyze, and develop mitigation strategies for likely risks in the current Risk Register. As of 3QFY15, the SEVIS program deployed SEVIS 6.20, Admissibility Indicator V1.4, and Performance Engineering 5. The releases position SEVIS to address action items specified in the February 2014 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) regarding system stabilization and vulnerability issues. Since the last assessment, the program has resolved 75% of the legacy system vulnerability issues. SEVIS is formulating an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to determine the solution set for closing the remaining vulnerabilities. Additionally, the AoA will also propose an alternative approach to support the SEVIS modernization initiative. The planned delivery of the AoA was scheduled for 1QFY16; however timeline has shifted with no update on delivery. The program continues to utilize Agile and Burn-Down charts for sprints resulting in high-quality cost estimates, which allows the program to maintain cost and schedule variance within OMB-acceptable range. The SEVIS Executive Steering Committee (ESC) continues to monitor program activities. An updated Operational Analysis scheduled for FY15 will address four key areas: customer results, innovation, strategic and business results and financial performance.   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Chief Information Officer (CIO) continues to assess the SEVIS program as a Moderately Low-Risk investment.\")"
